# RFD 103 - Application Access Web UI Auth Flow

## What

This is an overview of the flow used for setting the relevant cookies when a user logs in to an 
application through Teleport Web UI.

## Why

The method used to set cookies on a different domain requires a few changes to Teleport's default security 
mechanisms. It's important these changes are documented and understood for future reference.

## Details

When a user wants to login to an application, a new application session is created in
the auth service. This application session has two values (a name and a bearer token) that need to be provided 
as cookies when the user navigates to the application's URL.

The flow to be able to set the needed cookies from the application session across different domains is
as follows:

    User->>Proxy UI: Launch Application
    Proxy UI->>Auth Service: Create App Session /v1/webapi/sessions/app
    Auth Service->>Proxy UI: Returns two cookie values (app session & subject)
    Proxy UI->>Application: CORS preflight request to appurl.com/x-teleport-auth
    Application->>Proxy UI: Matches Origin against public proxy addresses & allows CORS if a match
    Proxy UI->>Application: POST appurl.com/x-teleport-auth with the cookie values in the header
    Application->>Proxy UI: Sets the cookies on appurl.com if they are valid
    Proxy UI->>User: User is logged in, redirect to appurl.com
```

### CORS

As we need to enable cross-origin requests from the proxy URL to the application URL, we add middleware
before `/x-teleport-auth` to check the `Origin` header (this cannot be changed via a `fetch` request).

We check the origin against the public addresses of the proxy, and if one is a match, we allow a cross-origin 
request.

The rules around the cross-origin request are strict and the absolute minimum needed:

- Must be a `POST` request
- Only allowed for the `/x-teleport-auth` endpoint
- Only allows the headers `X-Cookie-Value` and `X-Subject-Cookie-Value` to be set
- Only allowed from one of the public proxy addresses

### Content Security Policy

Teleport's default content security policy disallows cross-origin requests by setting `connect-src` to `'self' wss:`. 

To allow for the request to the application's domain, we modify the content security policy for `/web/launch` URLs
only. This changes `connect-src` to `'self' https://applicationfqdn:*`, which allows requests to both proxy as 
normal, and the application's FQDN.

### Cookie Validity Checking

In the handler for `/x-teleport-auth`, we take the cookie values from the headers and use `X-Cookie-Value` to 
look-up the application session created by the auth service.

If this application session exists, we then check the value of the `X-Subject-Cookie-Value` header against the
bearer token stored in the application session.

If these both match, we set the relevant cookies to log the user in once they're redirected to the application.
