## Manual Testing Plan

Below are the items that should be manually tested with each release of Teleport.
These tests should be run on both a fresh installation of the version to be released
as well as an upgrade of the previous version of Teleport.

- [ ] Adding nodes to a cluster
  - [ ] Adding Nodes via Valid Static Token
  - [ ] Adding Nodes via Valid Short-lived Tokens
  - [ ] Adding Nodes via Invalid Token Fails
  - [ ] Revoking Node Invitation

- [ ] Labels
  - [ ] Static Labels
  - [ ] Dynamic Labels

- [ ] Trusted Clusters
  - [ ] Adding Trusted Cluster Valid Static Token
  - [ ] Adding Trusted Cluster Valid Short-lived Token
  - [ ] Adding Trusted Cluster Invalid Token
  - [ ] Removing Trusted Cluster

- [ ] RBAC

  Make sure that invalid and valid attempts are reflected in audit log.

  - [ ] Successfully connect to node with correct role
  - [ ] Unsuccessfully connect to a node in a role restricting access by label
  - [ ] Unsuccessfully connect to a node in a role restricting access by invalid SSH login
  - [ ] Allow/deny role option: SSH agent forwarding
  - [ ] Allow/deny role option: Port forwarding
  - [ ] Allow/deny role option: SSH file copying

- [ ] Verify that custom PAM environment variables are available as expected.

- [ ] Users

    With every user combination, try to login and signup with invalid second
    factor, invalid password to see how the system reacts.

    WebAuthn in the release `tsh` binary is implemented using libfido2 for
    linux/macOS. Ask for a statically built pre-release binary for realistic
    tests. (`tsh fido2 diag` should work in our binary.) Webauthn in Windows
    build is implemented using `webauthn.dll`. (`tsh webauthn diag` with
    security key selected in dialog should work.)

    Touch ID requires a signed `tsh`, ask for a signed pre-release binary so you
    may run the tests.

    Windows Webauthn requires Windows 10 19H1 and device capable of Windows
    Hello.

  - [ ] Adding Users Password Only
  - [ ] Adding Users OTP
  - [ ] Adding Users WebAuthn
    - [ ] macOS/Linux
    - [ ] Windows
  - [ ] Adding Users via platform authenticator
    - [ ] Touch ID
    - [ ] Windows Hello
  - [ ] Managing MFA devices
    - [ ] Add an OTP device with `tsh mfa add`
    - [ ] Add a WebAuthn device with `tsh mfa add`
      - [ ] macOS/Linux
      - [ ] Windows
    - [ ] Add platform authenticator device with `tsh mfa add`
      - [ ] Touch ID
      - [ ] Windows Hello
    - [ ] List MFA devices with `tsh mfa ls`
    - [ ] Remove an OTP device with `tsh mfa rm`
    - [ ] Remove a WebAuthn device with `tsh mfa rm`
    - [ ] Attempt removing the last MFA device on the user
      - [ ] with `second_factor: on` in `auth_service`, should fail
      - [ ] with `second_factor: optional` in `auth_service`, should succeed
  - [ ] Login Password Only
  - [ ] Login with MFA
    - [ ] Add an OTP, a WebAuthn and a Touch ID/Windows Hello device with `tsh mfa add`
    - [ ] Login via OTP
    - [ ] Login via WebAuthn
      - [ ] macOS/Linux
      - [ ] Windows
    - [ ] Login via platform authenticator
      - [ ] Touch ID
      - [ ] Windows Hello
    - [ ] Login via WebAuthn using an U2F device

    U2F devices must be registered in a previous version of Teleport.

    Using Teleport v9, set `auth_service.authentication.second_factor = u2f`,
    restart the server and then register an U2F device (`tsh mfa add`). Upgrade
    the installation to the current Teleport version (one major at a time) and try to
    log in using the U2F device as your second factor - it should work.

  - [ ] Login OIDC
  - [ ] Login SAML
  - [ ] Login GitHub
  - [ ] Deleting Users

- [ ] Backends
  - [ ] Teleport runs with etcd
  - [ ] Teleport runs with dynamodb
  - [ ] Teleport runs with SQLite
  - [ ] Teleport runs with Firestore

- [ ] Session Recording
  - [ ] Session recording can be disabled
  - [ ] Sessions can be recorded at the node
    - [ ] Sessions in remote clusters are recorded in remote clusters
  - [ ] [Sessions can be recorded at the proxy](https://goteleport.com/docs/server-access/guides/recording-proxy-mode/)
    - [ ] Sessions on remote clusters are recorded in the local cluster
    - [ ] With an OpenSSH server without a Teleport CA signed host certificate:
      - [ ] Host key checking enabled rejects connection
      - [ ] Host key checking disabled allows connection

- [ ] Enhanced Session Recording
  - [ ] `disk`, `command` and `network` events are being logged.
  - [ ] Recorded events can be enforced by the `enhanced_recording` role option.
  - [ ] Enhanced session recording can be enabled on CentOS 7 with kernel 5.8+.

- [ ] Restricted Session 
  - [ ] Network request are allowed when a policy allow them.
  - [ ] Network request are blocked when a policy deny them.

- [ ] Audit Log
  - [ ] Failed login attempts are recorded
  - [ ] Interactive sessions have the correct Server ID
    - [ ] Server ID is the ID of the node in "session_recording: node" mode
    - [ ] Server ID is the ID of the proxy in "session_recording: proxy" mode

    Node/Proxy ID may be found at `/var/lib/teleport/host_uuid` in the
    corresponding machine.

    Node IDs may also be queried via `tctl nodes ls`.

  - [ ] Exec commands are recorded
  - [ ] `scp` commands are recorded
  - [ ] Subsystem results are recorded

    Subsystem testing may be achieved using both
    [Recording Proxy mode](
    https://goteleport.com/teleport/docs/architecture/proxy/#recording-proxy-mode)
    and
    [OpenSSH integration](
    https://goteleport.com/docs/server-access/guides/openssh/).

    Assuming the proxy is `proxy.example.com:3023` and `node1` is a node running
    OpenSSH/sshd, you may use the following command to trigger a subsystem audit
    log:

    ```shell
    sftp -o "ProxyCommand ssh -o 'ForwardAgent yes' -p 3023 %r@proxy.example.com -s proxy:%h:%p" root@node1
    ```

- [ ] Interact with a cluster using `tsh`

   These commands should ideally be tested for recording and non-recording modes as they are implemented in a different ways.

  - [ ] tsh ssh \<regular-node\>
  - [ ] tsh ssh \<node-remote-cluster\>
  - [ ] tsh ssh -A \<regular-node\>
  - [ ] tsh ssh -A \<node-remote-cluster\>
  - [ ] tsh ssh \<regular-node\> ls
  - [ ] tsh ssh \<node-remote-cluster\> ls
  - [ ] tsh join \<regular-node\>
  - [ ] tsh join \<node-remote-cluster\>
  - [ ] tsh play \<regular-node\>
  - [ ] tsh play \<node-remote-cluster\>
  - [ ] tsh scp \<regular-node\>
  - [ ] tsh scp \<node-remote-cluster\>
  - [ ] tsh ssh -L \<regular-node\>
  - [ ] tsh ssh -L \<node-remote-cluster\>
  - [ ] tsh ls
  - [ ] tsh clusters

- [ ] Interact with a cluster using `ssh`
   Make sure to test both recording and regular proxy modes.
  - [ ] ssh \<regular-node\>
  - [ ] ssh \<node-remote-cluster\>
  - [ ] ssh -A \<regular-node\>
  - [ ] ssh -A \<node-remote-cluster\>
  - [ ] ssh \<regular-node\> ls
  - [ ] ssh \<node-remote-cluster\> ls
  - [ ] scp \<regular-node\>
  - [ ] scp \<node-remote-cluster\>
  - [ ] ssh -L \<regular-node\>
  - [ ] ssh -L \<node-remote-cluster\>

- [ ] Verify proxy jump functionality
  Log into leaf cluster via root, shut down the root proxy and verify proxy jump works.
  - [ ] tls routing disabled
    - [ ] tsh ssh -J \<leaf.proxy.example.com:3023\>
    - [ ] ssh -J \<leaf.proxy.example.com:3023\>
  - [ ] tls routing enabled
    - [ ] tsh ssh -J \<leaf.proxy.example.com:3080\>
    - [ ] tsh proxy ssh -J \<leaf.proxy.example.com:3080\>

- [ ] Interact with a cluster using the Web UI
  - [ ] Connect to a Teleport node
  - [ ] Connect to a OpenSSH node
  - [ ] Check agent forwarding is correct based on role and proxy mode.

- [ ] `tsh` CA loading

  Create a trusted cluster pair with a node in the leaf cluster. Log into the root cluster.
  - [ ] `load_all_cas` on the root auth server is `false` (default) -
  `tsh ssh leaf.node.example.com` results in access denied.
  - [ ] `load_all_cas` on the root auth server is `true` - `tsh ssh leaf.node.example.com`
  succeeds.

### User accounting

- [ ] Verify that active interactive sessions are tracked in `/var/run/utmp` on Linux.
- [ ] Verify that interactive sessions are logged in `/var/log/wtmp` on Linux.

interactive sessions the 12 combinations are below.

- [ ] Connect to a OpenSSH node in a local cluster using OpenSSH.
- [ ] Connect to a OpenSSH node in a local cluster using Teleport.
- [ ] Connect to a OpenSSH node in a local cluster using the Web UI.

  * [ ] Verify that all kubes registered are shown with correct `name` and `labels`
  * [ ] Verify that clicking on a rows connect button renders a dialogue on manual instructions with `Step 2` login value matching the rows `name` column
  * [ ] Verify searching for `name` or `labels` in the search bar works
  * [ ] Verify you can sort by `name` colum
* [ ] Test Kubernetes exec via WebSockets - [client](https://github.com/kubernetes-client/javascript/blob/45b68c98e62b6cc4152189b9fd4a27ad32781bc4/examples/typescript/exec/exec-example.ts)

### Kubernetes Secret Storage

* [ ] Kubernetes Secret storage for Agent's Identity
    * [ ] Install Teleport agent with a short-lived token  
      * [ ] Validate if the Teleport is installed as a Kubernetes `Statefulset`
      * [ ] Restart the agent after token TTL expires to see if it reuses the same identity.
    * [ ] Force cluster CA rotation


### Teleport with FIPS mode

* [ ] Perform trusted clusters, Web and SSH sanity check with all teleport components deployed in FIPS mode.

### ACME

- [ ] Teleport can fetch TLS certificate automatically using ACME protocol.

### Migrations

* [ ] Migrate trusted clusters from 2.4.0 to 2.5.0
  * [ ] Migrate auth server on main cluster, then rest of the servers on main cluster
        SSH should work for both main and old clusters
  * [ ] Migrate auth server on remote cluster, then rest of the remote cluster
       SSH should work

### Command Templates

When interacting with a cluster, the following command templates are useful:

#### OpenSSH

```
# when connecting to the recording proxy, `-o 'ForwardAgent yes'` is required.
ssh -o "ProxyCommand ssh -o 'ForwardAgent yes' -p 3023 %r@proxy.example.com -s proxy:%h:%p" \
  node.example.com

# the above command only forwards the agent to the proxy, to forward the agent
# to the target node, `-o 'ForwardAgent yes'` needs to be passed twice.
ssh -o "ForwardAgent yes" \
  -o "ProxyCommand ssh -o 'ForwardAgent yes' -p 3023 %r@proxy.example.com -s proxy:%h:%p" \
  node.example.com

# when connecting to a remote cluster using OpenSSH, the subsystem request is
# updated with the name of the remote cluster.
ssh -o "ProxyCommand ssh -o 'ForwardAgent yes' -p 3023 %r@proxy.example.com -s proxy:%h:%p@foo.com" \
  node.foo.com
```

#### Teleport

```
# when connecting to a OpenSSH node, remember `-p 22` needs to be passed.
tsh --proxy=proxy.example.com --user=<username> --insecure ssh -p 22 node.example.com

# an agent can be forwarded to the target node with `-A`
tsh --proxy=proxy.example.com --user=<username> --insecure ssh -A -p 22 node.example.com

# the --cluster flag is used to connect to a node in a remote cluster.
tsh --proxy=proxy.example.com --user=<username> --insecure ssh --cluster=foo.com -p 22 node.foo.com
```

### `tctl sso` family of commands

For help with setting up sso connectors, check out the [Quick GitHub/SAML/OIDC Setup Tips]

`tctl sso configure` helps to construct a valid connector definition:

- [ ] `tctl sso configure github ...` creates valid connector definitions
- [ ] `tctl sso configure oidc ...` creates valid connector definitions
- [ ] `tctl sso configure saml ...` creates valid connector definitions

`tctl sso test` test a provided connector definition, which can be loaded from
file or piped in with `tctl sso configure` or `tctl get --with-secrets`. Valid
connectors are accepted, invalid are rejected with sensible error messages.

- [ ] Connectors can be tested with `tctl sso test`.

  `TELEPORT_TEST_EC2=1 go test ./integration -run TestIAMNodeJoin`
- [ ] EC2 Join method in IoT mode with node and auth in different AWS accounts
- [ ] IAM Join method in IoT mode with node and auth in different AWS accounts

### Kubernetes Node Joining
- [ ] Join a Teleport node running in the same Kubernetes cluster via a Kubernetes ProvisionToken

### Cloud Labels
- [ ] Create an EC2 instance with [tags in instance metadata enabled](https://goteleport.com/docs/management/guides/ec2-tags/)
and with tag `foo`: `bar`. Verify that a node running on the instance has label
`aws/foo=bar`.
- [ ] Create an Azure VM with tag `foo`: `bar`. Verify that a node running on the
instance has label `azure/foo=bar`.

### Passwordless

This feature has additional build requirements, so it should be tested with a pre-release build from Drone (eg: `https://get.gravitational.com/teleport-v10.0.0-alpha.2-linux-amd64-bin.tar.gz`).

This sections complements "Users -> Managing MFA devices". `tsh` binaries for
each operating system (Linux, macOS and Windows) must be tested separately for
FIDO2 items.

- [ ] Diagnostics

    Commands should pass all tests.

```
kind: role
metadata:
  name: allow-roles-and-nodes
spec:
  allow:
    logins:
    - root
    node_labels:
      '*': '*'

  - [ ] MacOS

## Machine ID

### SSH

With a default Teleport instance configured with a SSH node:

- [ ] Verify you are able to create a new bot user with `tctl bots add robot --roles=access`. Follow the instructions provided in the output to start `tbot`
- [ ] Verify you are able to connect to the SSH node using openssh with the generated `ssh_config` in the destination directory
- [ ] Verify that after the renewal period (default 20m, but this can be reduced via configuration), that newly generated certificates are placed in the destination directory
- [ ] Verify that sending both `SIGUSR1` and `SIGHUP` to a running tbot process causes a renewal and new certificates to be generated
- [ ] Verify that you are able to make a connection to the SSH node using the `ssh_config` provided by `tbot` after each phase of a manual CA rotation.

Ensure the above tests are completed for both:

- [ ] Directly connecting to the auth server
- [ ] Connecting to the auth server via the proxy reverse tunnel

### DB Access

With a default Postgres DB instance, a Teleport instance configured with DB access and a bot user configured:

- [ ] Verify you are able to connect to and interact with a database using `tbot db` while `tbot start` is running

## Teleport Connect

- Auth methods
   - Verify that the app supports clusters using different auth settings
     (`auth_service.authentication` in the cluster config):
      - [ ] `type: local`, `second_factor: "off"`
      - [ ] `type: local`, `second_factor: "otp"`
      - [ ] `type: local`, `second_factor: "webauthn"`,
      - [ ] `type: local`, `second_factor: "webauthn"`, log in passwordlessly with hardware key
      - [ ] `type: local`, `second_factor: "webauthn"`, log in passwordlessly with touch ID
      - [ ] `type: local`, `second_factor: "optional"`, log in without MFA

      - [ ] `type: local`, `second_factor: "on"`, log in with OTP
      - [ ] `type: local`, `second_factor: "on"`, log in with hardware key
      - [ ] `type: local`, `second_factor: "on"`, log in with passwordless auth
      - [ ] Verify that the passwordless credential picker works.
         - To make the picker show up, you need to add the same MFA device with passwordless
           capabilities to multiple users.
      - [Authentication connectors](https://goteleport.com/docs/setup/reference/authentication/#authentication-connectors):
         - For those you might want to use clusters that are deployed on the web, specified in
           parens. Or set up the connectors on a local enterprise cluster following [the guide from
           our wiki](https://gravitational.slab.com/posts/quick-git-hub-saml-oidc-setup-6dfp292a).
         - [ ] GitHub (asteroid)
            - [ ] local login on a GitHub-enabled cluster
         - [ ] SAML (platform cluster)
         - [ ] OIDC (e-demo)
- Shell
   - [ ] Verify that the shell is pinned to the correct cluster (for root clusters and leaf
     clusters).
      - That is, opening new shell sessions in other workspaces or other clusters within the same
        workspace should have no impact on the original shell session.
   - [ ] Verify that the local shell is opened with correct env vars.
      - `TELEPORT_PROXY` and `TELEPORT_CLUSTER` should pin the session to the correct cluster.
      - `TELEPORT_HOME` should point to `~/Library/Application Support/Teleport Connect/tsh`.
      - `PATH` should include `/Applications/Teleport Connect.app/Contents/Resources/bin`.
   - [ ] Verify that the working directory in the tab title is updated when you change the directory
         (only for local terminals).
   - [ ] Verify that terminal resize works for both local and remote shells.
      - Install midnight commander on the node you ssh into: `$ sudo apt-get install mc`
      - Run the program: `$ mc`
      - Resize Teleport Connect to see if the panels resize with it
   - [ ] Verify that the tab automatically closes on `$ exit` command.
   - [ ] Execute `tsh ssh nonexistent-node` in the command bar. Verify that you see a new tab with an
     error from tsh ssh.
- Kubernetes access
   - [ ] Open a new kubernetes tab, run `echo $KUBECONFIG` and check if it points to the file within Connect's app data directory. 
   - [ ] Close the tab and open it again (to the same resource). Verify if the kubeconfig path didn't change.
   - [ ] Run `kubectl get pods` and see if the command succeeds. 
   - Verify if the kubeconfig file is removed when the user:
      - [ ] Removes the connection
      - [ ] Logs out of the cluster
- State restoration from disk
   - [ ] Verify that the app asks about restoring previous tabs when launched and restores them
         properly.
   - [ ] Verify that the app opens with the cluster that was active when you closed the app.
   - [ ] Verify that the app remembers size & position after restart.
   - [ ] Verify that [reopening a cluster that has no workspace
     assigned](https://github.com/gravitational/webapps.e/issues/275#issuecomment-1131663575) works.
   - [ ] Verify that reopening the app after removing `~/Library/Application Support/Teleport
     Connect/tsh` doesn't crash the app.
   - [ ] Verify that reopening the app after removing `~/Library/Application Support/Teleport
     Connect/app_state.json` but not the `tsh` dir doesn't crash the app.
   - [ ] Verify that logging out of a cluster and then logging in to the same cluster doesn't
     remember previous tabs (they should be cleared on logout).
   - [ ] Open a db connection tab. Change the db name and port. Close the tab. Restart the app. Open
     connection tracker and choose said db connection from it. Verify that the newly opened tab uses
     the same db name and port.
   - [ ] Log in to a cluster. Close the DocumentCluster tab. Open a new DocumentCluster tab. Restart
     the app. Verify that the app doesn't ask you about restoring previous tabs.
- Connections picker
   - [ ] Verify that the connections picker shows new connections when ssh & db tabs are opened.
   - [ ] Check if those connections are available after the app restart.
   - [ ] Check that those connections are removed after you log out of the root cluster that they
         belong to.
   - [ ] Verify that reopening a db connection from the connections picker remembers last used port.
- Cluster resources (servers, databases, k8s)
   - [ ] Verify that the app shows the same resources as the Web UI.
   - [ ] Verify that search is working for the resources lists.
   - [ ] Verify that pagination is working for the resources lists.
   - [ ] Verify that pagination works in tandem with search, that is verify that search results are
         paginated too.
   - [ ] Verify that you can connect to these resources.
   - [ ] Verify that clicking "Connect" shows available logins and db usernames.
      - Logins and db usernames are taken from the role, under `spec.allow.logins` and
        `spec.allow.db_users`.
   - [ ] Repeat the above steps for resources in leaf clusters.
- Tabs
   - [ ] Verify that tabs have correct titles set.
   - [ ] Verify that changing tab position works.
- Shortcuts
   - [ ] Verify that switching between tabs works on `Cmd+[1...9]`.
   - [ ] Verify that other shortcuts are shown after you close all tabs.
   - [ ] Verify that the other shortcuts work and each of them is shown on hover on relevant UI
     elements.
- Workspaces & cluster management
   - [ ] Verify that logging in to a new cluster adds it to the identity switcher and switches to
     the workspace of that cluster automatically.
   - [ ] Verify that the state of the current workspace is preserved when you change the workspace
     (by switching to another cluster) and return to the previous workspace.
   - [ ] Click "Add another cluster", provide an address to a cluster that was already added. Verify
     that Connect simply changes the workspace to that of that cluster.
   - [ ] Click "Add another cluster", provide an address to a new cluster and submit the form. Close
     the modal when asked for credentials. Verify that the cluster was still added and is visible in
     the profile selector.
- Command bar & autocomplete
   - Do the steps for the root cluster, then switch to a leaf cluster and repeat them.
   - [ ] Verify that the autocomplete for tsh ssh filters SSH logins and autocompletes them.
   - [ ] Verify that the autocomplete for tsh ssh filters SSH hosts by name and label and
     autocompletes them.
   - [ ] Verify that launching an invalid tsh ssh command shows the error in a new tab.
   - [ ] Verify that launching a valid tsh ssh command opens a new tab with the session opened.
   - [ ] Verify that the autocomplete for tsh proxy db filters databases by name and label and
     autocompletes them.
   - [ ] Verify that launching a tsh proxy db command opens a new local shell with the command
     running.
   - [ ] Verify that the autocomplete for tsh ssh doesn't break when you cut/paste commands in
     various points.
   - [ ] Verify that manually typing out what the autocomplete would suggest doesn't break the
     command bar.
   - [ ] Verify that launching any other command that's not supported by the autocomplete opens a
     new local shell with that command running.
- Resilience when resources become unavailable
   - DocumentCluster
      - For each scenario, create at least one DocumentCluster tab for each available resource kind.
      - For each scenario, first do the action described in the bullet point, then refetch list of
        resources by entering the search field and pressing enter. Verify that no unrecoverable
        error was raised (that is, the app still works). Then restart the app and verify that it was
        restarted gracefully (no unrecoverable error on restart, the user can continue using the
        app).
         - [ ] Stop the root cluster.
         - [ ] Stop a leaf cluster.
         - [ ] Disconnect your device from the internet.
   - DocumentGateway
      - [ ] Verify that you can't open more than one tab for the same db server + username pair.
        Trying to open a second tab with the same pair should just switch you to the already
        existing tab.
      - [ ] Create a db connection tab for a given database. Then remove access to that db for that
        user. Go back to Connect and change the database name and port. Both actions should not
        return an error.
      - [ ] Open DocumentCluster and make sure a given db is visible on the list of available dbs.
        Click "Connect" to show a list of db users. Now remove access to that db. Go back to Connect
        and choose a username. Verify that a recoverable error is shown and the user can continue
        using the app.
      - [ ] Create a db connection, close the app, run `tsh proxy db` with the same port, start the
        app. Verify that the app doesn't crash and the db connection tab shows you the error
        (address in use) and offers a way to retry creating the connection.
- File transfer
   - Download
      - [ ] Verify if Connect asks for a path when downloading the file.
      - [ ] Verify that invalid paths and network errors are handled.
      - [ ] Verify if cancelling the download works.
   - Upload
      - [ ] Verify if uploading single/multiple files works.
      - [ ] Verify that invalid paths and network errors are handled.
      - [ ] Verify if cancelling the upload works.
- Refreshing certs
   - To test scenarios from this section, create a user with a role that has TTL of `1m`
     (`spec.options.max_session_ttl`).
   - Log in, create a db connection and run the CLI command; wait for the cert to expire, make
     another connection to the local db proxy.
      - [ ] Verify that the window received focus and a modal login is shown.
      - Verify that after successfully logging in:
         - [ ] The cluster info is synced.
         - [ ] The first connection wasn't dropped; try executing `select now();`, the client should
           be able to automatically reinstantiate the connection.
         - [ ] The database proxy is able to handle new connections; click "Run" in the db tab and
           see if it connects without problems. You might need to resync the cluster again in case
           they managed to expire.
      - [ ] Verify that closing the login modal without logging in shows an appropriate error.
   - Log in, create a db connection, then remove access to that db server for that user; wait for
     the cert to expire, then attempt to make a connection through the proxy; log in.
      - [ ] Verify that the db tab shows an appropriate error.
   - Log in, open a cluster tab, wait for the cert to expire. Switch from a servers view to
     databases view.
      - [ ] Verify that a login modal was shown.
      - [ ] Verify that after logging in, the database list is shown.

## Host users creation

[Host users creation docs](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/13056)
[Host users creation RFD](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/11077)
<!---
TODO(lxea): replace links with actual docs once merged

[Host users creation docs](../../docs/pages/server-access/guides/host-user-creation.mdx)
[Host users creation RFD](../../rfd/0057-automatic-user-provisioning.md)
-->

- Verify host users creation functionality
  - [ ] non-existing users are created automatically
  - [ ] users are added to groups
    - [ ] non-existing configured groups are created
	- [ ] created users are added to the `teleport-system` group
  - [ ] users are cleaned up after their session ends
	- [ ] cleanup occurs if a program was left running after session ends
  - [ ] sudoers file creation is successful
	- [ ] Invalid sudoers files are _not_ created
  - [ ] existing host users are not modified
  - [ ] setting `disable_create_host_user: true` stops user creation from occurring

## CA rotations

- Verify the CA rotation functionality itself (by checking in the backend or with `tctl get cert_authority`)
  - [ ] `standby` phase: only `active_keys`, no `additional_trusted_keys`
  - [ ] `init` phase: `active_keys` and `additional_trusted_keys`
  - [ ] `update_clients` and `update_servers` phases: the certs from the `init` phase are swapped
  - [ ] `standby` phase: only the new certs remain in `active_keys`, nothing in `additional_trusted_keys`
  - [ ] `rollback` phase (second pass, after completing a regular rotation): same content as in the `init` phase
  - [ ] `standby` phase after `rollback`: same content as in the previous `standby` phase
- Verify functionality in all phases (clients might have to log in again in lieu of waiting for credentials to expire between phases)
  - [ ] SSH session in tsh from a previous phase
  - [ ] SSH session in web UI from a previous phase
  - [ ] New SSH session with tsh
  - [ ] New SSH session with web UI
  - [ ] New SSH session in a child cluster on the same major version
  - [ ] New SSH session in a child cluster on the previous major version
  - [ ] New SSH session from a parent cluster
  - [ ] Application access through a browser
  - [ ] Application access through curl with `tsh app login`
  - [ ] `kubectl get po` after `tsh kube login`
  - [ ] Database access (no configuration change should be necessary if the database CA isn't rotated, other Teleport functionality should not be affected if only the database CA is rotated)

## EC2 Discovery

[EC2 Discovery docs](https://goteleport.com/docs/ver/11.0/server-access/guides/ec2-discovery/)

- Verify EC2 instance discovery
  - [ ]  Only EC2 instances matching given AWS tags have the installer executed on them
  - [ ]  Only the IAM permissions mentioned in the discovery docs are required for operation
  - [ ]  Custom scripts specified in different matchers are executed
  - [ ] Custom SSM documents specified in different matchers are executed
  - [ ] New EC2 instances with matching AWS tags are discovered and added to the teleport cluster
    - [ ] Large numbers of EC2 instances (51+) are all successfully added to the cluster
  - [ ] Nodes that have been discovered do not have the install script run on the node multiple times

## Documentation
