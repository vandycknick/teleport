# This workflow combines all open Dependabot PRs into a single batched
# PR, links all the Dependabot PRs to the new one, and closes all the
# Dependabot PRs. The schedule is set to exactly 12 hours after the
# Dependabot schedule.
#
# All workflows that run on PR should be skipped for Dependabot PRs
# to prevent wasting CI cycles.
