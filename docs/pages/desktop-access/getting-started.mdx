title: Getting Started with Desktop Access
description: Access Windows systems through Teleport Desktop Access
---

This guide will help you configure Teleport to provide secure, passwordless access
to Windows desktops. This configuration does not require an Active Directory domain.

If you are running Windows in an AD environment, consider integrating Teleport
with Active Directory for automatic discovery by reading [Desktop Access with
Active Directory](./active-directory.mdx). You can also mix Active Directory
integration with the static host definitions described below.

<Details
  title="Version warning"
  opened={true}
  scope={["oss", "enterprise"]}
  scopeOnly={true}
  min="12.0"
>
Windows Access without Active Directory is available starting from Teleport `v12`.
Previous versions of Teleport can implement Windows Access by integrating with
an [Active Directory domain](./active-directory.mdx).

Teleport Desktop Access is not yet compatible with Windows Server 2022.

## Prerequisites

- (!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- A Linux server to run the Teleport Desktop Access service on.
  You can reuse an existing server running any other Teleport instance.

- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)

## Step 1/4. Prepare Windows

### Import the Teleport root certificate

Use `tctl` to export the Teleport root certificate:

```code
$ tctl auth export --type=windows > teleport.cer
```

Copy this certificate to your Windows system, if you didn't run `tctl` from there.

### Install the Teleport service for Windows

From the Windows system, download the [Teleport service installer](#LinkToCome) {/*Rename as needed */}
and run it. When prompted, select the Teleport certificate file from the previous step.
Once complete, reboot the system.

## Step 2/4. Install the Teleport Desktop Service

On the Linux host where you will run the Desktop Service, install Teleport (if
you plan on running the Windows protocol on the same host as an existing Teleport
service, you can skip this step):

(!docs/pages/includes/install-linux.mdx!)

Define the Desktop Access service and list the Windows systems configured for
access through Teleport in `/etc/teleport.yaml`.

```yml
version: v3
teleport:
  nodename: example.teleport.com
  proxy_server: teleport-proxy.example.com:443
windows_desktop_service:
  enabled: yes
  non_ad_hosts:
    - 192.0.2.156
```

<Details title="Add labels to hosts">
You can attach labels to your Windows hosts by matching to their hostnames.
For example, to add the `cloud: ec2` label to hosts with EC2 private IP DNS names:

```diff
version: v3
teleport:
  nodename: example.teleport.com
  proxy_server: teleport-proxy.example.com:443
windows_desktop_service:
  enabled: yes
  non_ad_hosts:
-    - 192.0.2.156
+    - ip-192-0-2-156.us-east-2.compute.internal
+ host_labels:
+    - match: '.*\.us-east-2.compute.internal'
+      labels:
+        cloud: ec2
```

</Details>

Start or restart the Teleport Service. For new Teleport nodes, the examples below
depend on how you installed Teleport (from a system package or a TAR archive):

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="System Package">

```code
$ sudo systemctl start teleport.service
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Tar Archive">

```code
$ sudo teleport install systemd --output=/etc/systemd/system/teleport.service;
$ sudo systemctl enable teleport;
$ sudo systemctl start teleport;
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Step 3/4. Configure Windows access

In order to gain access to a remote desktop, a Teleport user needs to have the
appropriate permissions for that desktop.

Create the file `windows-desktop-admins.yaml`:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v6
metadata:
  name: windows-desktop-admins
spec:
  allow:
    windows_desktop_labels:
      "*": "*"
    windows_desktop_logins: ["Administrator", "alice"]
```

You can restrict access to specific hosts by defining values for
`windows_desktop_labels`, and adjust the array of usernames this role has access
to in `windows_desktop_logins`.

<Admonition type="warning" title="RBAC Configuration">
Ensure that each Teleport user is only assigned Windows logins that they should
be allowed to access.
</Admonition>

Apply the new role to your cluster:

```code
$ tctl create -f windows-desktop-admins.yaml
```

(\!docs/pages/includes/add-role-to-user.mdx role="windows-desktop-admins" \!)

See the [RBAC page](./rbac.mdx) for more information about setting up
Windows Desktop Access permissions.

See the [Access Controls Getting Started](../access-controls/getting-started.mdx#step-13-add-local-users-with-preset-roles)
guide for instructions on how to create or update a user with a given role.

## Step 4/4. Connect

You can now connect to your Windows desktops from the Teleport Web UI:
