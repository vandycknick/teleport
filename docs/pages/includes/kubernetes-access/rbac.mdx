### Kubernetes authentication

To authenticate to a Kubernetes cluster via Teleport, your Teleport roles must
allow access as at least one Kubernetes user or group. Ensure that you have a
Teleport role that grants access to the cluster you plan to interact with.

Run the following command to get the Kubernetes user for your current context:

```code
$ kubectl config view \
-o jsonpath="{.contexts[?(@.name==\"$(kubectl config current-context)\")].context.user}"
```

Create a file called `kube-access.yaml` with the following content, replacing
`USER` with the output of the command above.

```yaml
kind: role
metadata:
  name: kube-access
version: v6
spec:
  allow:
    kubernetes_labels:
      '*': '*'
    kubernetes_resources:
      - kind: pod
        namespace: "*"
        name: "*"
    kubernetes_groups:
    - viewers
    kubernetes_users:
    - USER
  deny: {}
```

Apply your changes:

```code
$ tctl create -f kube-access.yaml
```

(!docs/pages/includes/add-role-to-user.mdx role="kube-access"!)

Now that Teleport RBAC is configured, you can authenticate to your Kubernetes
cluster via Teleport. To interact with your Kubernetes cluster, you will need to
configure authorization within Kubernetes.

### Kubernetes authorization

To configure authorization within your Kubernetes cluster, you need to create Kubernetes `RoleBinding`s or
`ClusterRoleBindings` that grant permissions to the subjects listed in `kubernetes_users` and
`kubernetes_groups`.

For example, you can grant some limited read-only permissions to the `viewers` group used in the `kube-access`
role defined above:

Create a file called `viewers-bind.yaml` with the following contents:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: viewers-crb
subjects:
- kind: Group
  # Bind the group "viewers", corresponding to the kubernetes_groups we assigned our "kube-access" role above
  name: viewers
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
  kind: ClusterRole
  # "view" is a default ClusterRole that grants read-only access to resources
  # See: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/#user-facing-roles
  name: view
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

Apply the `ClusterRoleBinding` with `kubectl`:

```code
$ kubectl apply -f viewers-bind.yaml
```

Log out of Teleport and log in again.
