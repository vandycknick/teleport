Teleport assigns a subdomain to each application you have configured for Application
Access (e.g., `grafana.teleport.example.com`), so you will need to ensure that a
DNS A (or CNAME for services that only provide a hostname) record exists for each
application-specific subdomain so clients can access your applications via Teleport.

You should create either a separate DNS record for each subdomain, or a single
record with a wildcard subdomain such as `*.teleport.example.com`. This way, your
certificate authority (e.g., Let's Encrypt) can issue a certificate for each
subdomain, enabling clients to verify your Teleport hosts regardless of the
application they are accessing.
