Using Teleport's TLS routing mode behind a layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS) proxy is generally not supported, due to
these proxies terminating TLS themselves and then rewriting their requests to the upstream service, stripping
the additional SNI/ALPN parts of the request in the process. In order for ALPN to work correctly, the Teleport
proxy must terminate TLS itself.

Broadly, this means that Teleport's TLS routing functionality is incompatible with:
- AWS ALBs (Application Load Balancers)
- AWS NLBs (Network Load Balancers), when using a TLS listener and a public ACM (Amazon Certificate Manager) certificate
- Commonly used HTTP reverse proxies including nginx, Apache, Caddy, Traefik, HAProxy and many others
- Cloudflare tunnels in their default configuration

Deploying Teleport in TLS routing mode behind an HTTP proxy will result in a Teleport Web UI experience that seems
to work perfectly, but the use of `tsh`, `tctl` and attempting to join remote Teleport services to the cluster will fail
with errors like `ssh: overflow reading version string` and `EOF`. A functioning Teleport Web UI is not always an indication
of a correctly configured Teleport cluster.

If in doubt, remove all load balancers/proxies from the equation and connect Teleport clients or agent processes directly to
Teleport's web port to isolate the issue.

To use Teleport behind a reverse proxy, you should either:
- use a layer 4 (TCP) proxy which forwards TCP streams directly to Teleport (which will in turn handle TLS termination itself)
- disable Teleport's TLS routing mode by adding `version: v1` to your config file and removing `proxy_listener_mode: multiplex`
 
You can get an example `v1` config file using `teleport configure --version=v1 --public-addr=teleport.example.com:443` (change the public address to your own domain)

If disabling TLS routing, you can find the list of default ports to use for connecting different Teleport services at [ports without TLS routing](../reference/networking.mdx#ports-without-tls-routing)
