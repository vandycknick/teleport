If your deployment of Teleport services brings you over your default service
quotas, you can request a quota increase from the AWS Support Center. See
Amazon's [AWS service quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html)
documentation for more information.

For example, when using DynamoDB as the backend for Teleport cluster state, you
may need to request increases for read/write quotas.
