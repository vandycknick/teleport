title: Using the tsh Command Line Tool
description: Using the tsh command line tool
---

This guide will show you how to use the Teleport client tool, `tsh`.

You will learn how to:

- Log in to an interactive shell on remote cluster nodes.
- Copy files to and from cluster nodes.
- Connect to SSH clusters behind firewalls without any open ports using SSH
  reverse tunnels.
- Explore a cluster and execute commands on specific nodes in the cluster.
- Share interactive shell sessions with colleagues or join someone else's session.
- List and replay recorded interactive sessions.

In addition to this document, you can always simply type `tsh` into your
terminal for the CLI reference.

## Introduction

For the impatient, here's an example of how a user would typically use
[`tsh`](../reference/cli.mdx#tsh):

<ScopedBlock scope={["oss","enterprise"]}>

```code
# Log into a Teleport cluster. This command retrieves the user's certificates
# and saves them into ~/.tsh/teleport.example.com
$ tsh login --proxy=teleport.example.com

# SSH into a Node as usual
$ tsh ssh user@node

# `tsh ssh` takes the same arguments as the OpenSSH client:
$ tsh ssh -o ForwardAgent=yes user@node
$ tsh ssh -o AddKeysToAgent=yes user@node

# You can even create a convenient symlink:
$ ln -s /path/to/tsh /path/to/ssh

# ... and now your 'ssh' command is calling Teleport's `tsh ssh`
$ ssh user@host

# This command removes SSH certificates from a user's machine:
$ tsh logout
```

</ScopedBlock>
<ScopedBlock scope={["cloud"]}>

```code
# Login into a Teleport cluster. This command retrieves the user's certificates
# and saves them into ~/.tsh/mytenant.teleport.sh
$ tsh login --proxy=mytenant.teleport.sh

# SSH into a Node as usual
$ tsh ssh user@node

# `tsh ssh` takes the same arguments as the OpenSSH client:
$ tsh ssh -o ForwardAgent=yes user@node
$ tsh ssh -o AddKeysToAgent=yes user@node

# You can even create a convenient symlink:
$ ln -s /path/to/tsh /path/to/ssh

# ... and now your 'ssh' command is calling Teleport's `tsh ssh`
$ ssh user@host

# This command removes SSH certificates from a user's machine:
$ tsh logout
```

</ScopedBlock>

In other words, Teleport was designed to be fully compatible with existing
SSH-based workflows and does not require users to learn anything new, other than
to call [`tsh login`](../reference/cli.mdx#tsh-login) in the beginning.

## Installing tsh

Follow [these install instructions](../installation.mdx) to obtain the `tsh`
binary. Ideally, install `tsh` of the same version as the version used in your
Teleport cluster.

## User identities

A user identity in Teleport exists in the scope of a cluster. The member nodes
of a cluster may have multiple OS users on them. A Teleport administrator
assigns allowed logins to every Teleport user account.

When logging into a remote node, you will have to specify both the Teleport
login and the OS login. A Teleport identity will have to be passed via the
`--user` flag while the OS login will be passed as `login@host` using syntax
compatible with the traditional `ssh` command.

</ScopedBlock>

[CLI Docs - tsh ssh](../reference/cli.mdx#tsh-ssh)

## Logging in

To retrieve a user's certificate, execute:

<ScopedBlock scope={["oss", "enterprise"]}>

```code
# Full form:
$ tsh login --proxy=proxy_host:<https_proxy_port>,<ssh_proxy_port>

# Using default ports:
$ tsh login --proxy=work.example.com

# Using custom HTTPS port:
$ tsh login --proxy=work.example.com:5000

# Using a custom SSH proxy port, which is set on the Auth Server:
$ tsh login --proxy=work.example.com:2002
```

</ScopedBlock>
<ScopedBlock scope={["cloud"]}>

```code
# Full form:
$ tsh login --proxy=proxy_host:<https_proxy_port>,<ssh_proxy_port>

$ tsh login --proxy=mytenant.teleport.sh
```

</ScopedBlock>

[CLI Docs - tsh login](../reference/cli.mdx#tsh-login)

| Port | Description |
| - | - |
| https_proxy_port | the HTTPS port the proxy host is listening to (defaults to `3080`). |
| ssh_proxy_port | the SSH port the proxy is listening to (defaults to `3023`). |

The login command retrieves a user's certificate and stores it in `~/.tsh`
directory as well as in the [ssh agent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ssh-agent) if there is one running.

This allows you to authenticate just once, maybe at the beginning of the day. Subsequent `tsh ssh` commands will run without asking for credentials until the temporary certificate expires. By default, Teleport issues user certificates with a time to live (TTL) of 12 hours.

<Admonition
  type="tip"
  title="Tip"
>
  It is recommended to always use [`tsh login`](../reference/cli.mdx#tsh-login) before using any other `tsh` commands. This allows users to omit `--proxy` flag in subsequent tsh commands. For example `tsh ssh user@host` will work.
</Admonition>

A Teleport cluster can be configured for multiple user identity sources. For example, a cluster may have a local user called `admin` while regular users should [authenticate via GitHub](../access-controls/sso/github-sso.mdx). In this case, you have to pass `--auth` flag to `tsh login` to specify which identity storage to use:

<ScopedBlock scope={["oss", "enterprise"]}>

```code
# Log in using the local Teleport 'admin' user:
$ tsh --proxy=proxy.example.com --auth=local --user=admin login

# Log in using GitHub as an SSO provider, assuming the GitHub connector is called "github"
$ tsh --proxy=proxy.example.com --auth=github login
```

</ScopedBlock>
<ScopedBlock scope={["cloud"]}>

```code
# Log in using the local Teleport 'admin' user:
$ tsh --proxy=mytenant.teleport.sh --auth=local --user=admin login

# Log in using GitHub as an SSO provider, assuming the GitHub connector is called "github"
$ tsh --proxy=mytenant.teleport.sh --auth=github login
```

</ScopedBlock>

When using an external identity provider to log in, `tsh` will need to open a
web browser to complete the authentication flow. By default, `tsh` will use your
system's default browser. If you wish to suppress this behavior, you can use the
`--browser=none` flag:

<ScopedBlock scope={["oss", "enterprise"]}>

```code
# Don't open the system default browser when logging in
$ tsh login --proxy=work.example.com --browser=none
```

</ScopedBlock>
<ScopedBlock scope={["cloud"]}>

```code
# Don't open the system default browser when logging in
$ tsh login --proxy=mytenant.teleport.sh --browser=none
```

</ScopedBlock>

In this situation, a link will be printed on the screen. You can copy and paste this link into
a browser of your choice to continue the login flow.

[CLI Docs - tsh login](../reference/cli.mdx#tsh-login)

### Inspecting an SSH certificate

To inspect the SSH certificates in `~/.tsh`, a user may execute the following
command:

<ScopedBlock scope={["oss", "enterprise"]}>

```code
$ tsh status

# > Profile URL:  https://proxy.example.com:3080
#   Logged in as: johndoe
#  Cluster:      proxy.example.com
#   Roles:        admin*
#   Logins:       root, admin, guest
#   Kubernetes:   disabled
#  Valid until:  2017-04-25 15:02:30 -0700 PDT [valid for 1h0m0s]
#  Extensions:   permit-agent-forwarding, permit-port-forwarding, permit-pty
```

</ScopedBlock>
<ScopedBlock scope={["cloud"]}>

```code
$ tsh status

# > Profile URL:  https://mytenant.teleport.sh:3080
#   Logged in as: johndoe
#  Cluster:      mytenant.teleport.sh
#   Roles:        admin*
#   Logins:       root, admin, guest
#   Kubernetes:   disabled
#  Valid until:  2017-04-25 15:02:30 -0700 PDT [valid for 1h0m0s]
#  Extensions:   permit-agent-forwarding, permit-port-forwarding, permit-pty
```

</ScopedBlock>

[CLI Docs - tsh status](../reference/cli.mdx#tsh-status)

### SSH agent support

If there is an [ssh agent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ssh-agent) running,
`tsh login` will store the user certificate in the agent. This can be verified
via:

```code
$ ssh-add -L
```

The SSH agent can be used to feed the certificate to other SSH clients, for example
to OpenSSH (`ssh`).

If you wish to disable SSH agent integration, pass `--no-use-local-ssh-agent`
to `tsh`. You can also set the `TELEPORT_USE_LOCAL_SSH_AGENT` environment
variable to `false` in your shell profile to make this permanent.

### Identity files

[`tsh login`](../reference/cli.mdx#tsh-login) can also save the user certificate into a
file:

<ScopedBlock scope={["oss", "enterprise"]}>

```code
# Authenticate the user against proxy.example.com and save the user
# certificate to joe.pem
$ tsh login --proxy=proxy.example.com --out=joe

# Use joe.pem to log in to the server 'db'
$ tsh ssh --proxy=proxy.example.com -i joe joe@db
```

</ScopedBlock>
<ScopedBlock scope={["cloud"]}>

```code
# Authenticate the user against mytenant.teleport.sh and save the user
# certificate to joe.pem
$ tsh login --proxy=mytenant.teleport.sh --out=joe

# Use joe.pem to log in to the server 'db'
$ tsh ssh --proxy=mytenant.teleport.sh -i joe joe@db
```

</ScopedBlock>

By default, the `--out` flag will create an identity file suitable for `tsh -i`.
If compatibility with OpenSSH is needed, `--format=openssh` must be specified.
In this case, the identity will be saved into two files, `joe` and
`joe-cert.pub`:

<ScopedBlock scope={["oss", "enterprise"]}>

```code
$ tsh login --proxy=proxy.example.com --out=joe --format=openssh
$ ls -lh

# total 8.0K
# -rw------- 1 joe staff 1.7K Aug 10 16:16 joe
# -rw------- 1 joe staff 1.5K Aug 10 16:16 joe-cert.pub
```

</ScopedBlock>
<ScopedBlock scope={["cloud"]}>

```code
$ tsh login --proxy=mytenant.teleport.sh --out=joe --format=openssh
$ ls -lh

# total 8.0K
# -rw------- 1 joe staff 1.7K Aug 10 16:16 joe
# -rw------- 1 joe staff 1.5K Aug 10 16:16 joe-cert.pub
```

</ScopedBlock>

### SSH certificates for automation

Regular users of Teleport must request an auto-expiring SSH certificate, usually
every day. This doesn't work for non-interactive scripts, like cron jobs or a
CI/CD pipeline.

For this kind of automation, it is recommended to create a separate Teleport
user for bots and request a certificate for them with a long time to live (TTL).

In this example, we're creating a certificate with a TTL of one hour for the
`jenkins` user and storing it in a `jenkins.pem` file, which can be later used with
`-i` (identity) flag for `tsh`.

<ScopedBlock scope={["oss", "enterprise"]}>

```code
# Log in to your cluster with tsh so you can use tctl from your local machine.
# You can also run tctl on your Auth Service host without running "tsh login"
# first.
$ tsh login --proxy=teleport.example.com --user=myuser
$ tctl auth sign --ttl=1h --user=jenkins --out=jenkins.pem
```

</ScopedBlock>
<ScopedBlock scope={["cloud"]}>

```code
# Log in to your Teleport Cloud cluster so you can use tctl locally.
$ tsh login --proxy=myinstance.teleport.sh --user=email@example.com
$ tctl auth sign --ttl=1h --user=jenkins --out=jenkins.pem
```

</ScopedBlock>

[CLI Docs - tctl auth sign](../reference/cli.mdx#tctl-auth-sign)

Now `jenkins.pem` can be copied to the Jenkins server and passed to the `-i`
(identity file) flag of `tsh`.

`tctl auth sign` is an admin's equivalent of `tsh login --out` and allows for
unrestricted certificate TTL values.

For non-production usage, you can use
[Machine ID](../machine-id/introduction.mdx), currently in preview, to
provide your bot user with automatically updated, short-lived credentials.

## Exploring the cluster

In a Teleport cluster, all Nodes periodically ping the cluster's Auth Service
and update their status. This allows Teleport users to see which Nodes are
online with the `tsh ls` command:

```code
# This command lists all Nodes in the cluster you logged into via "tsh login":
$ tsh ls

# Node Name     Address            Labels
# ---------     -------            ------
# turing        10.1.0.5:3022      os:linux
# turing        10.1.0.6:3022      os:linux
# graviton      10.1.0.7:3022      os:osx
```

[CLI Docs - tsh ls](../reference/cli.mdx#tsh-ls)

`tsh ls` can apply a filter based on the node labels.

```code
# Only show Nodes with os label set to 'osx':
$ tsh ls os=osx

# Nodename      UUID                   Address            Labels
# ---------     -------                -------            ------
# graviton      33333333-aaaa-1284     10.1.0.7:3022      os:osx
```

[CLI Docs -tsh ls](../reference/cli.mdx#tsh-ls)

(!docs/pages/includes/node-logins.mdx!)

</Details>

## Interactive shell

To launch an interactive shell on a remote Node or to execute a command, use
`tsh ssh`.

`tsh` tries to mimic the `ssh` experience as much as possible, so it supports
the most popular `ssh` flags like `-p`, `-l` or `-L`. For example, if you have
the following alias defined in your `~/.bashrc`: `alias ssh="tsh ssh"` then you
can continue using familiar SSH syntax:

<ScopedBlock scope={["oss", "enterprise"]}>

```code
# Have this alias configured, perhaps via ~/.bashrc
$ alias ssh="/usr/local/bin/tsh ssh"

# Login in to a cluster and retrieve your SSH certificate:
$ tsh --proxy=proxy.example.com login

# These commands execute `tsh ssh` under the hood:
$ ssh user@node
$ ssh -p 6122 user@node ls
$ ssh -o ForwardAgent=yes user@node
$ ssh -o AddKeysToAgent=yes user@node
```

</ScopedBlock>
<ScopedBlock scope={["cloud"]}>

```code
# Have this alias configured, perhaps via ~/.bashrc
$ alias ssh="/usr/local/bin/tsh ssh"

# Login in to a cluster and retrieve your SSH certificate:
$ tsh --proxy=mytenant.teleport.sh login

# These commands execute `tsh ssh` under the hood:
$ ssh user@node
$ ssh -p 6122 user@node ls
$ ssh -o ForwardAgent=yes user@node
$ ssh -o AddKeysToAgent=yes user@node
```

</ScopedBlock>

<ScopedBlock scope={["oss", "enterprise"]}>

### Proxy ports

By default, the Teleport Proxy Service listens on port `3080`.

If a Teleport Proxy Service instance is configured to listen on non-default
ports, they must be specified via `--proxy` flag as shown:

```code
$ tsh --proxy=proxy.example.com:5000 <subcommand>
```

This `tsh` command will use port `5000` of the Proxy Service.

</ScopedBlock>

### Port forwarding

`tsh ssh` supports the OpenSSH `-L` flag which forwards incoming
connections from localhost to the specified remote host:port. The syntax of `-L`
flag is as follows, where "bind_ip" defaults to `127.0.0.1`:

```code
$ -L [bind_ip]:listen_port:remote_host:remote_port
```

Example:

```code
$ tsh ssh -L 5000:web.remote:80 node
```

This will connect to remote server `node` via the Proxy Service, then open a
listening socket on `localhost:5000`. Finally, it will forward all incoming
connections to `web.remote:80` via this SSH tunnel.

It is often convenient to establish port forwarding, execute a local command
which uses the connection, and then disconnect. You can do this with the `--local`
flag.

Example:

```code
$ tsh ssh -L 5000:google.com:80 --local node curl http://localhost:5000
```

This command:

1. Connects to `node`.
2. Binds the local port `5000` to port `80` on `google.com`.
3. Executes `curl` command locally, which results in `curl` hitting `google.com:80` via `node`.

### SSH jump host

While implementing `ProxyJump` for Teleport, we have extended the feature to `tsh`.

<ScopedBlock scope={["oss", "enterprise"]}>

```code
$ tsh ssh -J proxy.example.com telenode
```

</ScopedBlock>
<ScopedBlock scope={["cloud"]}>

```code
$ tsh ssh -J mytenant.teleport.sh telenode
```

</ScopedBlock>

Known limitations:

- Only one jump host is supported (`-J` supports chaining that Teleport does not utilize) and `tsh` will return with error in the case of two jump hosts, i.e. `-J proxy-1.example.com,proxy-2.example.com` will not work.
- When `tsh ssh -J user@proxy` is used, it overrides the SSH proxy defined in the tsh profile, and port forwarding is used instead of the existing Teleport proxy subsystem.

### Resolving Node names

`tsh` supports multiple methods to resolve remote Node names.

1. **Traditional**: by IP address or via DNS.
2. **Nodename setting**: the `teleport` daemon supports the` nodename` flag, which allows Teleport administrators to assign alternative Node names.
3. **Labels**: you can address a Node by `name=value` pair.

If we have two Node, one with `os:linux` label and one Node with `os:osx`, we
can log in to the OSX Node with:

```code
$ tsh ssh os=osx
```

This only works if there is only one remote node with the `os:osx` label, but
you can still execute commands via SSH on multiple Nodes using labels as a
selector. This command will update all system packages on machines that run
Linux:

```code
$ tsh ssh os=ubuntu apt-get update -y
```

### Short-lived sessions

The default TTL of a Teleport user certificate is 12 hours. This can be modified
at login with the `--ttl` flag. This command logs you into the cluster with a
very short-lived (1 minute) temporary certificate:

```code
$ tsh --ttl=1 login
```

You will be logged out after one minute, but if you want to log out immediately,
you can always run:

```code
$ tsh logout
```

## Copying files

To securely copy files to and from cluster Nodes, use the `tsh scp` command. It
is designed to mimic OpenSSH's `scp` command as much as possible:

```code
$ tsh scp example.txt root@node:/path/to/dest
```

Again, you may want to create a bash alias like `alias scp="tsh --proxy=work
scp"` and use the familiar syntax:

```code
$ scp -P 61122 -r files root@node:/path/to/dest
```

Starting from Teleport 9 the SCP and SFTP protocols are both supported by Server
Access. OpenSSH `scp` or `sftp` commands can both be used in place of `tsh scp`
if desired. 

## Sharing sessions

Suppose you are trying to troubleshoot a problem on a remote server. Sometimes
it makes sense to ask another team member for help. Traditionally, this could be
done by letting them know which host you're on, having them SSH in, start a
terminal multiplexer like `screen`, and join a session there.

Teleport makes this more convenient. Let's log in to a server named `luna`
and ask Teleport for our current session status:

```code
$ tsh ssh luna
# on host luna
$ teleport status

# User ID    : joe, logged in as joe from 10.0.10.1 43026 3022
# Session ID : 7645d523-60cb-436d-b732-99c5df14b7c4
Session URL: https://work:3080/web/sessions/7645d523-60cb-436d-b732-99c5df14b7c4
```

Now you can invite another user account to the `work` cluster. You can share the
URL for access through a web browser, or you can share the session ID, and the
other user can join you through their terminal by typing:

```code
$ tsh join <session_ID>
```

<Admonition
  type="tip"
  title="Lacking permission?"
>
  Joining sessions requires special permissions that need to be set up by your cluster administrator.
  Refer them to the [Moderated Sessions guide](../access-controls/guides/moderated-sessions.mdx) for more information on configuring join permissions.
</Admonition>

<Notice type="note" scope={["oss", "enterprise"]}>
  Joining sessions is not supported in recording proxy mode (where `session_recording` is set to `proxy`).
</Notice>

## Connecting to SSH clusters behind firewalls

Teleport supports creating clusters of servers located behind firewalls
**without any open listening TCP ports**.  This works by creating reverse SSH
tunnels from behind-firewall environments into a Teleport Proxy Service you have access to.

These features are called **Trusted Clusters**. Refer to [the Trusted Clusters guide](../management/admin/trustedclusters.mdx)
to learn how a Trusted Cluster can be configured.

<ScopedBlock scope={["oss", "enterprise"]}>

Assuming the Teleport Proxy Server called `work` is configured with a few Trusted
Clusters, a user may use the `tsh clusters` command to see a list of all Trusted Clusters on the server:

```code
$ tsh --proxy=work clusters

# Cluster Name     Status
# ------------     ------
# staging          online
# production       offline
```

</ScopedBlock>
<ScopedBlock scope={["cloud"]}>

Assuming the Teleport Cloud tenant called `mytenant.teleport.sh` is configured with a few trusted
clusters, a user may use the `tsh clusters` command to see a list of all Trusted Clusters on the server:

```code
$ tsh --proxy=mytenant.teleport.sh clusters

# Cluster Name     Status
# ------------     ------
# staging          online
# production       offline
```

</ScopedBlock>

[CLI Docs - tsh clusters](../reference/cli.mdx#tsh-clusters)

Now you can use the `--cluster` flag with any `tsh` command. For example, to list SSH nodes that are members of the `production` cluster, simply run:

<ScopedBlock scope={["oss", "enterprise"]}>

```code
$ tsh --proxy=work ls --cluster=production

# Node Name     Node ID       Address            Labels
# ---------     -------       -------            ------
# db-1          xxxxxxxxx     10.0.20.31:3022    kernel:4.4
# db-2          xxxxxxxxx     10.0.20.41:3022    kernel:4.2
```

</ScopedBlock>
<ScopedBlock scope={["cloud"]}>

```code
$ tsh --proxy=mytenant.teleport.sh ls --cluster=production

# Node Name     Node ID       Address            Labels
# ---------     -------       -------            ------
# db-1          xxxxxxxxx     10.0.20.31:3022    kernel:4.4
# db-2          xxxxxxxxx     10.0.20.41:3022    kernel:4.2
```

</ScopedBlock>

Similarly, if you want to SSH into `db-1` inside the `production` cluster:

<ScopedBlock scope={["oss", "enterprise"]}>

```code
$ tsh --proxy=work ssh --cluster=production db-1
```

This is possible even if Nodes in the `production` cluster are located behind a
firewall without open ports. This works because the `production` cluster
establishes a reverse SSH tunnel back into the Proxy Service called `work`, and
this tunnel is used to establish inbound SSH connections.

</ScopedBlock>
<ScopedBlock scope={["cloud"]}>

```code
$ tsh --proxy=mytenant.teleport.sh ssh --cluster=production db-1
```

This is possible even if Nodes in the `production` cluster are located behind a
firewall without open ports. This works because the `production` cluster
establishes a reverse SSH tunnel back into your Teleport Cloud tenant's Proxy
Service, and this tunnel is used to establish inbound SSH connections.

</ScopedBlock>

## X11 forwarding

In order to run graphical programs within an SSH session, such as an IDE like
Virtual Studio Code, you'll need to request X11 forwarding for the session with
the `-X` flag.

```code
$ tsh ssh -X node01
```

X11 forwarding provides the server with secure access to your local X Server
so that it can communicate directly with your local display and I/O devices.

<Notice type="note">
  The `-Y` flag can be used to start Trusted X11 forwarding. This is needed
  in order to enable more "unsafe" features, such as running clipboard or
  screenshot utilities like `xclip`. However, it provides the server with
  unmitigated access to your local X Server and puts your local machine at
  risk of X11 attacks, so it should only be used with extreme caution.
</Notice>

In order to use X11 forwarding, you'll need to enable it on the Teleport Node.
You'll also need to ensure that your user has the `permit_x11_forwarding` role option:

```code
$ tsh status
> Profile URL:        https://proxy.example.com:3080
  Logged in as:       dev
  ...
  Extensions:         permit-X11-forwarding
```

## Custom aliases and defaults

You can configure `tsh` to define aliases, custom commands and command-specific flag defaults. Using aliases, you can run frequently used `tsh` commands more easily. 

Aliases are defined in configuration files using the following syntax:

```yaml
aliases:
    "<alias>": "<command>"
```

The `<alias>` can only be a top-level subcommand. In other words, you can define `tsh mycommand` alias but not `tsh my command`.

`tsh` loads two kinds of configuration files:

- global: by default `/etc/tsh.yaml`, unless overridden by  the `$TELEPORT_GLOBAL_TSH_CONFIG` env var.
- user-specific: `$TELEPORT_HOME/config/config.yaml`, which by defaults resolves to `~/.tsh/config/config.yaml`.

`tsh` merges the user-specific config with the global config. In case of conflicts (i.e. same alias defined in both files), the user-specific config has higher priority.

In either of those files you can add define an alias such as:

```yaml
aliases:
    "l": "tsh login --auth=okta"
```

From now on, `tsh l` will resolve to `tsh login --auth=okta`.

You can also change the defaults for regular `tsh` commands:

```yaml
aliases:
    "status": "tsh status --format=json"
```

Calling external programs other than `tsh` is also possible:

```yaml
aliases:
    "connect": "bash -c 'tsh login $0 && tsh ssh $1'"
```

The example above demonstrates the usage of variables `$0` and `$1`. They represent arguments provided to the alias. With the definition above, `tsh connect foo bar` resolves to `bash -c 'tsh login foo && tsh ssh bar'`. 

The alias can use as many arguments as needed. If the alias is invoked with too few arguments, `tsh` will report an error. Conversely, providing additional arguments is *not* an error. `tsh` will append any additional arguments to the end of an alias definition.

Given the configuration:

```yaml
aliases:
    "example": "bash -c 'echo first=$0 $0-$1 $3'"
```

`tsh example 0 1 unused-2 3 unused-4` will expand to `bash -c 'echo first=0 0-1 3 unused-2 unused-4'`.

You can also add the `$TSH` variable to an alias definition. When invoking the alias, `tsh` will expand this to the absolute path to current `tsh` executable. This can be useful if there are multiple `tsh` versions installed, or the currently used version is not in `PATH`.

```yaml
aliases:
    "status": "$TSH status --format=json"
```

The alias substitution happens before the command line flags are fully parsed. This means that it is not affected by the `--debug` flag. To troubleshoot your aliases, set the `TELEPORT_DEBUG=1` environment variable instead. This will cause the `tsh` logs to be printed to the console:

```bash
$ TELEPORT_DEBUG=1 tsh status
DEBU [TSH]       Self re-exec command: tsh [status --format=json]. tsh/aliases.go:203
...
```

# Interactive Recording

Within the Teleport cluster the Server and Kubernetes recorded sessions are available for listing and replay for authorized users via `tsh`.
The same listings, including Desktop Access sessions, are available in the Web Console under Session Recordings in the Activity section.

## List and Play Recordings

Get the list of recorded sessions. By default, recordings for the past 24 hours are shown.
The time range can be customized with the `--last`, `--from-utc`, and `--to-utc` flags.

```code
$ tsh recordings ls
ID                                   Type Participants Hostname Timestamp           
------------------------------------ ---- ------------ -------- ------------------- 
b0a04442-70dc-4be8-9308-7b7901d2d600 ssh  jeff         dev       Nov 26 16:36:16 UTC 
c0a02222-70dc-4be8-9308-7b7901d2d600 kube alice                  Nov 26 20:36:16 UTC 
d0a04442-70dc-4be8-9308-7b7901d2d600 ssh  navin        test      Nov 26 16:36:16 UTC 
```

To play sessions, use the `tsh play <sessionid>` command. The screen will reset playing the interactive session with the timestamp in the upper right.

```code
$ tsh play c0a02222-70dc-4be8-9308-7b7901d2d600
