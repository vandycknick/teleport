title: How to Contribute to Teleport's Documentation
description: Follow this guide to get started contributing changes to Teleport's documentation
---

This guide describes the general workflow for making documentation changes.
It assumes you already have Node >=14 and `yarn` installed.

## Step 1/4 Set up your local environment

Clone the `gravitational/docs` repository via `git clone`:

```code
$ git clone https://github.com/gravitational/docs
```

Different versions of the documentation are organized into the `content`
directory of `gravitational/docs`. Each subdirectory of `content` includes a git
submodule for a different branch of `gravitational/teleport`.

Navigate to the root of your local clone of the `gravitational/docs` repository
and run the following command to populate the `content` directory:

```code
$ yarn git-update
```

Next, navigate to the directory under `content` that corresponds to the latest version of Teleport.

```code
$ cd content/(=version=)
```

Switch to the master branch (or versioned branch for updates specific to previous versions):

```code
git switch master
```

Check out a new branch of `gravitational/teleport`.

```code
$ git switch -c my-branch
```

## Step 2/4 Test your changes

Run the following command to start the development server:

```code
$ yarn install
$ yarn dev
```

You can visit the docs site at `localhost:3000/docs`. The development server
will detect changes to the documentation automatically as you make them and
refresh the page within the browser.

Validate your changes locally using the provided linters:

```code
# Check your Markdown syntax
$ yarn markdown-lint
# markdown-lint, but also checks that external links work
$ yarn markdown-lint-external-links
```

## Step 3/4 Create a pull request

Commit your changes and push your branch to `gravitational/teleport` (if you
work at Teleport) or a fork of `gravitational/teleport`.

```code
# If you are an external contributor, create a fork and push to it.
# This command assumes that you have created an SSH key pair and stored
# your public key in GitHub.
$ git remote add fork ssh://git@github.com/my-user/teleport
$ git rebase origin/master
$ git push -u fork my-branch
```

Visit https://github.com/gravitational/teleport and create a pull request (PR)
against your branch. Our continuous integration (CI) pipeline will automatically
assign reviewers to your PR. The best way to ensure that your PR is merged is to
respond to reviewer feedback in a timely manner. If feedback goes unaddressed
your PR may be closed due to inactivity. Please merge your PR as soon as
possible once you have received all required approvals.

## Step 4/4 Backport your changes

Since our docs site is versioned, we want to ensure that any changes you make to
the most recent version of our documentation are reflected for the versions of
Teleport we currently support.

<Admonition type="tip" title="Supported Versions">
You can find our list of currently supported versions in the FAQ:

</Admonition>

There are many ways to create a backport, and we will illustrate three common
methods for backporting Teleport documentation PRs.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Using GitHub Labels">

When you open a pull request, add labels of the format `backport/branch/v[0-9]+`
to backport your PR to different versioned branches of `gravitational/teleport`.

For example, to backport a change to v10 of the documentation, you would add the
label, `backport/branch/v10`.

When you merge your PR, our continuous integration pipeline will create a table
of links in the comments of the PR that let you create additional PRs for your
backports.

<Notice>

The label method will fail for forks of `gravitational/teleport`.

</Notice>

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Using make">

Navigate to the root of your `gravitational/teleport` clone and run the
following command, assigning the `PR` variable to the ID of your GitHub PR and
the `TO` variable to a comma-separated list of versioned branch names:

```code
$ PR=0000 TO=branch/v10 make backport
```

This script will automatically generate backport branches and open PRs for them.

<Notice>

The `make backport` method will fail for forks of `gravitational/teleport`.

</Notice>

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Manually">

If automatic backport methods have failed, you will need to backport manually.

We will illustrate a backport for Teleport version 8.x.x. In this example, we
have created a PR against `origin/master` from the branch `my-branch`, which has
been committed to our fork.

Copy the hash of the commit we made to `my-branch`, then run the following
commands:

```code
$ git fetch origin
$ git switch branch/v8
$ git switch -c my-branch-backport-v8
$ git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
$ git push -u fork my-branch-backport-v8
```

Finally, create a PR for your backport.
