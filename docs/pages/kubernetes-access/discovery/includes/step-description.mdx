The discovery process requires two separate Teleport components. The first, the Discovery Service, is 
responsible for watching the cloud provider and checking if there are any 
new clusters or if there have been any modifications to previously discovered clusters. 
The second, the Kubernetes Service, monitors the clusters created by the Discovery Service and 
is responsible for authenticating and forwarding requests into them.

<Notice type="tip">

This guide presents the Discovery and Kubernetes services running in 
the same process, however both can run independently and on different machines.
Running the processes independently is beneficial if access 
to different clusters requires Kubernetes Service to be on the same network as 
the cluster.
