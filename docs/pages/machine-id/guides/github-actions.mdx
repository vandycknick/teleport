  Machine ID for GitHub Actions is available starting from Teleport `v11.0`.
</Details>

GitHub Actions are a popular CI/CD platform that works as a part of the larger GitHub
ecosystem. Teleport, with the help of Machine ID, allows for GitHub Actions to
securely interact with Teleport protected resources without the need for long lived
credentials. By ensuring that rotated Machine ID credentials are additionally limited by RBAC,
GitHub Actions with Teleport can be applied as both a viable and secure solution whenever a
CI/CD platform is needed.

<Admonition type="note">
Currently GitHub Actions with Machine ID is unsupported on GitHub Enterprise
or self-hosted runners.

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- A node that is a part of the Teleport cluster with [Server Access](https://goteleport.com/docs/server-access/introduction/).
- A local workstation with `tsh` access to the cluster.
- A GitHub repository with GitHub Actions enabled. This guide uses the example `gravitational/example`
repo, however this value should be replaced with your own unique repo.

## Step 1/3. Create a join Token for GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions will need its own join token in order to join the cluster.
Using a text editor of your choice, create the configuration YAML file `tokenconfig.yaml` for the
join token that resembles the following:

```yaml
kind: token
version: v2
metadata:
  name: github-token
  expires: "3000-01-01T00:00:00Z"
spec:
  roles: [Bot]
  join_method: github
  bot_name: github-demo
  github:
    allow:
      - repository: gravitational/example
```

Let's go over the token configuration YAML in more detail:

- `metadata.name` defines the name of the token. Note that this value will need to be used in other parts of the configuration later.
- `metadata.expires` defines the date that the join token will expire. This example is set
to the year `3000`, however care should be taken in production in order to Ensure
that the expiration date will not be given a value that is greater than what is needed.
- `spec.bot_name` is the name of the Machine ID bot that this token will grant access to.
Note that this value will need to be used in other parts of the configuration later.
- `metadata.expires` defines the date that the join token will expire. This example is set
to the year `3000`, however care should be taken in production in order to Ensure
that the expiration date will not be given a value that is greater than what is needed.
- `spec.roles` defines the role for the bot user. The value of `[Bot]` is a pre-existing role
that ensures that only bots are allowed to join the cluster using this token, reducing the scope of privileges.
- `spec.join_method` defines the join method the token is applicable for. Since this guide
only focuses on GitHub Actions, this value should always be equal to `github`.
- `spec.github.allow` is used to set rules for what GitHub Actions will be able to
authenticate by using the token. In this example, the `gravitational/example`
repository is used, and this example repository should be replaced with your own repo.

Most of the configuration settings used in the example configuration file `tokenconfig.yaml`
do not have any variable settings, however the `allow` block of `spec.github.allow` has additional
configuration options to more strictly define which GitHub Actions tokens will be granted access to:

| **Setting** | **Behavior** | **Example** |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| `sub` | The subject associated with the GitHub Actions run. | `repo:example-org/example-repo:environment:development` |
| `repository` | The repository where the action is running. | `example-org/example` |
| `repository_owner` | The name of the organization that owns the repository where the action is running.  | `example-org` |
| `workflow`| The name of the [workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/about-workflows) that the running job belongs to. This references the `name` of a workflow defined within a workflow configuration file, and can be the workflow created in Step 3/3 of this guide. | `guide-demo` |
| `environment`| The name of the [environment](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment) associated with the action run. | `development` |
| `actor` | The GitHub account name that triggered the action run. | `username` |
| `ref` | The git "ref" or [reference](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/git/refs#about-the-git-references-api) that triggered the action run. | `refs/heads/example` |
| `ref_type` | The **type** of "ref" or reference that triggered the action run. | `branch` |

Once the configuration YAML file has been created, apply it to your cluster using `tctl`:

```code
$ tctl create -f tokenconfig.yaml
```

The token `github-token` can now be observed with the following command, ensuring that the configuring is ready to be used by
GitHub:

```code
$ tctl tokens ls
```

The output will resemble the following:

```code
Token       Type Labels Expiry Time (UTC)
----------- ---- ------ ----------------------------------------------
github-token Bot         01 Jan 00 00:00 UTC (2562047h47m16.854775807s)
```

## Step 2/3. Creating your Machine ID bot

With the join token for GitHub Actions created, the next step is to create the Machine ID bot,
and ensure that it is configured to use the newly created token. This bot can be created using a Teleport
`configuration.yaml` file, however for the purposes of this guide you will create a simple configuration
using `tctl` with any required configuration flags.

The Machine ID bot created in this example will be used to access a specific node on the cluster
via `tsh ssh`, and will therefore require a role that can access the cluster as needed. This example
configuration will apply the `access` role, however care should be taken to either create or apply
a role according to the principle of least privilege in production environments. Additionally, it
should have explicit access to the cluster using a username created specifically for the bot user alone.

Enter the following command from your workstation with `tsh` access, replacing the `username` value with
the username affiliated with a node the bot will be required to access over a `tsh ssh` session:

```
$ tctl bots add github-demo --roles=access --token=github-token â€“logins=username
```

## Step 3/3. Configuring GitHub Actions

Now that the bot has been successfully created, GitHub Actions can function as part of the Teleport cluster.

In the GitHub workflows directory of your repo (`.github/workflows/`) create a new workflow YAML file,
in this case `actionstest.yml`, that will reflect the action you'd like to configure. This guide will create an action that
will both list nodes within the cluster using `tsh ls`, as well as write the commit SHA that triggered the workflow to
a file within the bot node. To create this configuration, use the following YAML file:

```YAML
# This is a basic workflow to help you get started.
# It will take the following action whenever a push is made to the "main" branch.
on:
 push:
   branches:
     - main
jobs:
 demo:
   permissions:
# The "id-token: write" permission is required or tbot will not be able to authenticate.
     id-token: write
     contents: read
# The name of the workflow, and the Linux distro to be used to perform the required steps.
   name: guide-demo
   runs-on: ubuntu-latest
   steps:
     - name: Checkout repository
       uses: actions/checkout@v3
     - name: Fetch Teleport binaries
       uses: gravitational/teleport-actions/setup@main
       with:
         version: (=teleport.major_version=)
     - name: Fetch credentials
       run: >
         tbot start
         --join-method=github
         --token=github-token
# Use the address of the auth/proxy server for your own cluster.
         --auth-server=example.domain:443
         --oneshot
         --destination-dir=/opt/machine-id
         --data-dir=/opt/machine-id-data
     - name: List nodes
# Enters a command from the cluster, in this case "tsh ls" using Machine ID credentials to list remote SSH nodes.
# Ensure that the domain "authserver.domain" matches the auth/proxy server of your own cluster.
       run: >
         tsh -i ./opt/machine-id/identity
         --proxy=example.domain:443
         ls
     - name: Write file to remote
# Enters a command from the cluster, in this case "tsh ssh" using Machine ID credentials to gain SSH access to an SSH node, and then write the commit hash to the "github_run_log" file.
# Ensure that the domain matches the auth/proxy server, that `username` matches the username of a remote SSH username, and that hostname matches an SSH host name that is a part of the Teleport cluster configured for access.
       run: >
         tsh -i /opt/machine-id/identity
         --proxy example.domain:443
         ssh username@hostname
         "echo $GITHUB_SHA >> ~/github_run_log"
```

Add, commit, and push your changes to the `main` branch of the repository.

Navigate to the **Actions** tab of your GitHub repository in your web browser. Select
the **Workflow** that has now been created and triggered by the change, and select the `guide-demo` job.
The GitHub action may take some time to complete, and will resemble the following once successful.


![GitHub Actions](../../../img/machine-id/github-actions.png)

Expand the `List nodes` step of the action, and the output will
list all nodes in the cluster, from the perspective of the
TSH user configured for Machine ID using the command `tsh ls`.

## A note on security implications and risk

When working with GitHub Actions and `tbot` it is important to ensure that
the principal of least privilege is always applied and that security implications
are well understood and respected.

Using `tbot` commands with GitHub Actions means that GitHub Actions will
have access to certificates contained within your Teleport cluster, and therefore
a level of permitted access to your Teleport cluster. In order to reduce risk,
extra care should be taken when user implemented code, code that is not
otherwise well understood, or code that is otherwise untested is applied as part
of the same job.
