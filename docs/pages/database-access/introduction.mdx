description: Teleport Database Access introduction, demo and resources.

Teleport can provide secure connections to your databases while improving both
access control and visibility.

Some of the things you can do with Database Access:

- Users can retrieve short-lived database certificates using a Single Sign-On
  flow, thus maintaining their organization-wide identity.
- Configure role-based access controls for databases and implement custom
  [Access Request](../access-controls/access-requests.mdx) workflows.
- Capture database activity in the Teleport audit log.

Database Access currently supports the following databases:

- CockroachDB
- Elasticsearch
- MariaDB
- Microsoft SQL Server
- MongoDB
- MySQL
- PostgreSQL
- Redis
- Cassandra
- ScyllaDB

## Demo

Let's connect to a PostgreSQL server with `psql` and pgAdmin 4 after authenticating
with GitHub, execute a few SQL queries and observe them in the audit log:
