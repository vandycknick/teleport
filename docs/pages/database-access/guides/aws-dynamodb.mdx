title: Database Access with AWS DynamoDB
description: How to access AWS DynamoDB with Teleport Database Access
---

Access to AWS DynamoDB can be provided by [Teleport Database
Access](../introduction.mdx). This allows for
fine-grain access control through [Teleport's RBAC](../../database-access/rbac.mdx).

This guide will help you to:

- Install the Teleport Database Service.
- Set up the Teleport Database Service to access DynamoDB.
- Connect to your DynamoDB databases through the Teleport Database Service.

</ScopedBlock>

## Prerequisites

- A running Teleport cluster. If you don't already have Teleport running, see
  [How to Choose a Teleport Edition](../../choose-an-edition/introduction.mdx)
  to learn more about your options, and how to set up Teleport.
- AWS account with DynamoDB databases.
- IAM permissions to create IAM roles.
- `aws` Command Line Interface (CLI) tool installed in `$PATH`.
- A host, e.g., an EC2 instance, where you will run the Teleport Database Service.
  This guide assumes an EC2 instance when creating and applying IAM roles, and
  must be adjusted accordingly for custom configurations.

<Admonition type="tip" title="Not yet a Teleport user?">
If you have not yet deployed the Auth Service and Proxy Service, you should follow
one of our [getting started guides](../getting-started.mdx) or try our Teleport
Database Access [interactive learning track](https://play.instruqt.com/teleport/invite/imz8g1n1xzru).
</Admonition>

We will assume your Teleport cluster is accessible at `teleport.example.com`.
You can substitute the address of your Teleport Proxy Service. (For Teleport Cloud
customers, this will be similar to `mytenant.teleport.sh`.)

<Admonition type="note" title="Example Access Control">
This guide provides an example configuration of IAM access roles as a model,
and uses an EC2 instance to serve the Teleport Database Access service.
The level of access provided may not suit your needs, or may not fit your
organization's access conventions. You should adjust the AWS IAM permissions to fit your needs.
</Admonition>

## Step 1/4. Create IAM roles for DynamoDB access

The setup described in this guide requires two IAM roles: one associated with the EC2 instance running the Teleport Database Access service and another that can be assumed by the EC2 instance role and grants access to DynamoDB services.

### EC2 instance role

Visit the [IAM > Roles page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home#/roles) of
the AWS Console, then press "Create Role". Under **Trusted entity type** select
"AWS service". Under **Use case** select "EC2", then click **Next**.

![Create Role to Identify EC2 Instance](../../../img/database-access/guides/dynamodb-create-ec2-role.png)

On the "Add Permissions" page, you can simply click **Next** since this role does not require any permissions. In this guide, we will use the example name `TeleportDatabaseService` for this role. Once you have chosen a name, click **Create Role** to complete the process.

### DynamoDB access role

Navigate back to the Roles page and create a new role. Select the "AWS account"
option, which creates a default trust policy to allow other entities in this
account to assume this role:

![Create Role Step 1](../../../img/database-access/guides/dynamodb-create-role-1.png)

Click **Next**. Find the AWS-managed policy `AmazonDynamoDBFullAccess` and then select the policy:

![Create Role Step 2](../../../img/database-access/guides/dynamodb-create-role-2.png)

<Admonition type="note" title="Apply least-privilege permissions">
The `AmazonDynamoDBFullAccess` policy may grant more permissions than desired.
If you want to use a different IAM policy to reduce permissions, refer to
[Managing access permissions to your Amazon DynamoDB 
Resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/access-control-overview.html)
for more information.
</Admonition>

Click **Next**. On the next page, enter a role name. In this guide we'll use
the example name `ExampleTeleportDynamoDBRole` for this role.

Under "Select trusted entities", update the JSON to allow the `TeleportDatabaseService`
role to assume this role:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": [
                    "arn:aws:iam::(=aws.aws_access_key=):role/TeleportDatabaseService"
                ]
            },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
            "Condition": {}
        }
    ]
}
```

Finally, click **Create Role**.

## Step 2/4. Configure the Teleport IAM role mapping

The next step is to give your Teleport users permissions to assume IAM roles in
your Teleport cluster.

You can do this by creating a Teleport role with the `db_users` field
listing the IAM role ARN created in the previous step. Create a file called
`aws-dynamodb-access.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v6
metadata:
  name: aws-dynamodb-access
spec:
  allow:
    db_labels:
      '*': '*'
    db_users:
    - 'ExampleTeleportDynamoDBRole' # only the role name, do not specify the full AWS ARN
```

Create the new role:

```code
$ tctl create -f aws-dynamodb-access.yaml
```

(!docs/pages/includes/add-role-to-user.mdx role="aws-dynamodb-access"!)

## Step 3/4. Install the Teleport Database Service

Create an EC2 instance to host the Teleport Database Service, and attach the
`TeleportDatabaseService` AWS IAM role to it. If you're hosting the service another
way, you must provide AWS credentials to the service - see [AWS credentials
configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkref/latest/guide/creds-config-files.html)
for more details.

<Admonition type="warning" title="non-standard AWS regions">
For non-standard AWS regions such as AWS GovCloud (US) regions and AWS China
regions, please set the corresponding region in the `AWS_REGION` environment
variable or in the AWS credentials file so that the Database Service can use
the correct STS endpoint.
</Admonition>

### Generate a token

<Details title="Alterative methods">

For users with a lot of infrastructure in AWS, or who might create or recreate
many instances, consider alternative methods for joining new EC2 instances running
Teleport:

- [Configure Teleport to Automatically Enroll EC2 instances (Preview)](../../server-access/guides/ec2-discovery.mdx)
- [Joining Nodes via AWS IAM Role](../../management/guides/joining-nodes-aws-iam.mdx)
- [Joining Nodes via AWS EC2 Identity Document](../../management/guides/joining-nodes-aws-ec2.mdx)

</Details>

A join token is required to authorize a Teleport Database Service instance
to join the cluster. Generate a short-lived join token and save the output of
the command:

```code
$ tctl tokens add \
    --type=db \
    --db-name=example-dynamodb \
    --db-protocol=dynamodb
```

Use the token provided by the output of this command in the next step.

### Install and start Teleport

Install Teleport on the host where you will run the Teleport Database
Service. See our [Installation](../../installation.mdx) page for options
besides Linux servers.

(!docs/pages/includes/install-linux.mdx!)

Edit `/etc/teleport.yaml` to configure the database entry:

```yaml
version: v3
teleport:
  nodename: CHANGEME
  data_dir: /var/lib/teleport
  proxy_server: teleport.example.com
  auth_token: (=presets.tokens.first=)
  ca_pin:
  - (=presets.ca_pin=)
db_service:
  enabled: "yes"
  # Matchers for database resources created with "tctl create" command.
  # For more information: https://goteleport.com/docs/database-access/guides/dynamic-registration/
  resources:
  - labels:
      "*": "*"
  # Lists statically registered databases proxied by this agent.
  databases:
    - name: "example-dynamodb"
      protocol: "dynamodb"
      # optional uri, if uri is set then AWS region can be extracted from it
      # or if AWS region is already set then the regions must match.
      # uri: "dynamodb.us-east-1.amazonaws.com:443"
      static_labels:
        env: "dev"
      aws:
        region: "us-east-1"
        account_id: "(=aws.aws_access_key=)"
```

Now start the Teleport Database Service:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Package Manager">

```code
$ sudo systemctl start teleport
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="TAR archive">

```code
$ sudo teleport install systemd --output=/etc/systemd/system/teleport.service;
$ sudo systemctl enable teleport
$ sudo systemctl start teleport
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Step 4/4 Connect

Once the Database Service has started and joined the cluster, you can start
connecting to your DynamoDB database.

Create a proxy tunnel:

```code
$ tsh proxy db --tunnel --port 8000 --db-user=ExampleTeleportDynamoDBRole example-dynamodb
```

You can test the connection to the database through the `aws` cli:

```code
$ aws dynamodb list-tables --endpoint-url=http://localhost:8000
{
    "TableNames": [
        "table1",
        "table2",
        "table3"
    ]
}
```

You can also connect to this database from the AWS NoSQL Workbench, as documented in our [Database Access GUI Clients](../../connect-your-client/gui-clients.mdx#nosql-workbench) guide.

You can also use this tunnel for programmatic access. The example below uses the `boto3` SDK from AWS:

```python
$ python3
Python 3.10.4 (main, Mar 31 2022, 03:37:37) [Clang 12.0.0 ] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import boto3
>>> clt = boto3.client('dynamodb', endpoint_url='http://localhost:8000')
>>> res = clt.list_tables()
>>> print(res)
{'TableNames': *snip output*}
>>> 
```
