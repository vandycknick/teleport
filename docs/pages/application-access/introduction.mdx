# Application Access

Teleport Application Access is designed to provide secure access to
internal dashboards and applications, such as:

- Internal control panels.
- Tools, such as wikis, that are available only when connected to a VPN.
- Infrastructure dashboards, such as Kubernetes or Grafana.
- Developer tools, such as Jenkins, GitLab, or Opsgenie.

## Getting started

Get started with Application Access in a 10 minute [guide](./getting-started.mdx).

## Access guides

These guides explain basic Teleport Application Access usage.

- [Web App Access](./guides/connecting-apps.mdx): How to access web apps with Teleport Application Access.
- [TCP App Access (Preview)](./guides/tcp.mdx): How to access plain TCP apps with Teleport Application Access.
- [API Access](./guides/api-access.mdx): How to access REST APIs with Teleport Application Access.
- [AWS Access](./guides/aws-console.mdx): How to access AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, and AWS SDKs with Teleport Application Access.
- [Dynamic Registration](./guides/dynamic-registration.mdx): Register/unregister apps without restarting Teleport.
- [Interactive Lab](https://play.instruqt.com/teleport/invite/rgvuva4gzkon): Try Teleport using our guided Teleport Application Access lab.

## JWT guides

These guides explain how web apps behind Teleport Application Access can
leverage Teleport-signed JWT tokens to implement authentication and
authorization.

- [Introduction](./jwt/introduction.mdx): Introduction to JWT tokens with Application Access.
- [Elasticsearch](./jwt/elasticsearch.mdx): How to use JWT authentication with Elasticsearch.

## Example legacy apps

A load balancer might display network telemetry through 
a control panel but might lack the ability to authenticate with 
and be accessed by resources outside your private network.

Teleport lets team members access these resources securely, even outside a private network:

- Team members can access private resources securely using certificates and SSH tunnels.
- No sharing of resource secrets, passwords, or credentials.
- All interactions with any connected resource can be monitored, logged, and tracked.
- Now, private resources can securely communicate with other resources that aren't on the network.

Other common legacy app scenarios:

- An internal admin tool.
- Control panel for networking devices.

## Example modern apps

Teleport Application Access also supports modern web applications such as internal web
tools and infrastructure software:

- Kubernetes Dashboard.
- Grafana.
- Jupyter notebooks.
- In-house Single-Page Apps (SPA).
- SPA with custom JSON Web Token support (JWT).
