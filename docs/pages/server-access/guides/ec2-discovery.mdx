title: Configure Teleport to Automatically Enroll EC2 instances (Preview)
description: How to configure Teleport to automatically enroll EC2 instances.
---

The Teleport Discovery Service can connect to Amazon EC2 and
automatically discover and enroll EC2 instances matching configured
labels. It will then execute an install script on these discovered
instances using AWS Systems Manager that will install Teleport, start
it and join the cluster.

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- AWS account with EC2 instances and permissions to create and attach IAM policies as well as permission to create Systems Manager documents.
- EC2 instances running Ubuntu/Debian/RHEL/Amazon Linux 2 if making use of the default Teleport install script. (For other Linux distributions, you can install Teleport manually.) 

(!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)

## Step 1/5. Create an EC2 invite token

When discovering EC2 instances, Teleport makes use of IAM invite tokens for
authenticating joining Nodes.

Create a file called `token.yaml`:
```yaml
# token.yaml
kind: token
version: v2
metadata:
  # the token name is not a secret because instances must prove that they are
  # running in your AWS account to use this token
  name: aws-discovery-iam-token
  # set a long expiry time, as the default for tokens is only 30 minutes
  expires: "3000-01-01T00:00:00Z"
spec:
  # use the minimal set of roles required
  roles: [Node]

  # set the join method allowed for this token
  join_method: iam

  allow:
  # specify the AWS account which Nodes may join from
  - aws_account: "123456789"
```

Add the token to the Teleport cluster with:
```
tctl create -f token.yaml
```

## Step 2/5. Create an AWS Systems Manager Document

Teleport makes use of AWS Systems Manager documents to execute commands necessary to
install and start Teleport on discovered EC2 instances.

A document with the following content should be created, named `TeleportDiscoveryInstaller`:

```yaml
# document.yaml
---
schemaVersion: '2.2'
description: aws:runShellScript
parameters:
  token:
    type: String
    description: "(Required) The Teleport invite token to use when joining the cluster."
  scriptName:
    type: String
    description: "(Required) The Teleport installer script to use when joining the cluster."
mainSteps:
- action: aws:downloadContent
  name: downloadContent
  inputs:
    sourceType: "HTTP"
    destinationPath: "/tmp/installTeleport.sh"
    sourceInfo:
      url: "https://teleport.example.com/webapi/scripts/installer/{{ scriptName }}"
- action: aws:runShellScript
  name: runShellScript
  inputs:
    timeoutSeconds: '300'
    runCommand:
      - /bin/sh /tmp/installTeleport.sh "{{ token }}"
```

Here, `teleport.example.com` should be substituted with the public proxy URL of the
Teleport cluster, e.g. `mytenant.teleport.sh` for a Teleport Cloud tenant.

The document may be created by executing the following AWS command:
```code
$ aws ssm create-document \
     --content file://document.yaml \
     --name "TeleportDiscoveryInstaller" \
     --document-type "Command" \
     --document-format YAML
```

When Teleport executes the Systems Manager document it will provide the `token`
and `scriptName` parameters with defaults.

- `{{ scriptName }}` will by default evaluate to `default-installer`
- `{{ token }}` will by default evaluate to `aws-discovery-iam-token`

The document `TeleportDiscoveryInstaller` may be named differently
however the `discovery_service` section must be modified to include
the `ssm` section. For example:

```yaml
discovery_service:
  aws:
    - types: ["ec2"] 
      ssm:
        document_name: "OtherTeleportDiscoveryDocument"
```


## Step 3/5. Set up AWS IAM credentials

In order for Teleport to send commands to EC2 instances, the instance
performing discovery requires an IAM policy with permissions to
execute Systems Manager commands and retrieve EC2 instances:

```js
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ssm:SendCommand",
                "ec2:DescribeInstances",
                "ssm:GetCommandInvocation"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

All EC2 instances that are to be added to the Teleport cluster by the
Discovery Service must include the `AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore` IAM policy
in order to receive commands from the Discovery Service. 

This policy includes the following permissions:
```js
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ssm:DescribeAssociation",
                "ssm:GetDeployablePatchSnapshotForInstance",
                "ssm:GetDocument",
                "ssm:DescribeDocument",
                "ssm:GetManifest",
                "ssm:GetParameter",
                "ssm:GetParameters",
                "ssm:ListAssociations",
                "ssm:ListInstanceAssociations",
                "ssm:PutInventory",
                "ssm:PutComplianceItems",
                "ssm:PutConfigurePackageResult",
                "ssm:UpdateAssociationStatus",
                "ssm:UpdateInstanceAssociationStatus",
                "ssm:UpdateInstanceInformation"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ssmmessages:CreateControlChannel",
                "ssmmessages:CreateDataChannel",
                "ssmmessages:OpenControlChannel",
                "ssmmessages:OpenDataChannel"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ec2messages:AcknowledgeMessage",
                "ec2messages:DeleteMessage",
                "ec2messages:FailMessage",
                "ec2messages:GetEndpoint",
                "ec2messages:GetMessages",
                "ec2messages:SendReply"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Step 4/5. Configure Teleport to discover EC2 instances

The Teleport Discovery Service requires a valid auth token to connect
to the cluster. Generate one by running the following command against
your Teleport Auth Service and save it in `/tmp/token` on the Node
that will run the Discovery Service:

```code
$ tctl tokens add --type=discovery
```

In order to enable EC2 instance discovery the `discovery_service.aws` section must
include at least one entry:

```yaml
version: v2
teleport:
  join_params:
    token_name: "/tmp/token"
    method: token
  auth_servers:
  - "teleport.example.com:3080"
auth_service:
  enabled: off
proxy_service:
  enabled: off
ssh_service:
  enabled: off
discovery_service:
  enabled: "yes"
  aws:
   - types: ["ec2"]
     regions: ["us-east-1","us-west-1"]
     tags:
       "env": "prod" # Match EC2 instances where tag:env=prod
```

Once Teleport is configured for discovery, it can be started and EC2
instances matching the tags specified in the AWS section will begin to
be added to the Teleport cluster automatically.

## Step 5/5. [Optional] Customize the default installer script

To customize the default installer script, execute the following command on your workstation:
```code
$ tctl get installer/default-installer > teleport-default-installer.yaml
```
The resulting `teleport-default-installer.yaml` can the be edited to
change what gets executed when enrolling discovered EC2 instances.

After making the desired changes to the default installer, the
resource can be updated by executing:

```code
$ tctl create teleport-default-installer.yaml
```

Multiple `installer` resources can exist and be specified in the
`install/script_name` section:
```yaml
discovery_service:
  aws:
    - types: ["ec2"] 
      tags:
       - "env": "prod"
      install: # optional section when default-installer is used.
        script_name: "default-installer" 
    - types: ["ec2"] 
      tags:
       - "env": "devel"
      install:
        script_name: "devel-installer"		
```

---

The `installer` resource has the following templating options:
- `{{ .MajorVersion }}`: the major version of Teleport to use when
  installing from the repository.
- `{{ .PublicProxyAddr }}`: the public address of the Teleport Proxy Service to connect to.

These can be used as follows:
```yaml
kind: installer
metadata:
  name: default-installer
spec:
  script: |
    echo {{ .PublicProxyAddr }}
    echo Teleport-{{ .MajorVersion }}
version: v1
```
Which, when retrieved by the Systems Manager document will evaluate to a script with the following contents:
```sh
echo teleport.example.com
echo Teleport-(=teleport.version=)
```

The default installer will take the following actions:
- Add an official Teleport repository to supported Linux distributions.
- Install Teleport via `apt` or `yum`.
- Generate the Teleport config file and write it to `/etc/teleport.yaml`.
- Enable and start the Teleport service.

## Troubleshooting

If Installs are showing failed or instances are failing to appear check the Command history in AWS System Manager -> Node Management -> Run Command.  Select the instance-id of the Target to review Errors.
