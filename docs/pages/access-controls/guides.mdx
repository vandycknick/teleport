Teleport gives you fine-grained control over who can access resources in your
infrastructure as well as how they can access those resources. Once you have
deployed a Teleport cluster, configure access controls to achieve the right
security policies for your organization.

- [Dual Authorization](./guides/dual-authz.mdx): Protect access to critical resources with dual authorization.
- [Role Templates](./guides/role-templates.mdx): Set up dynamic access policies with role templates.
- [Impersonating Teleport Users](./guides/impersonation.mdx): Create certificates for other users with impersonation.
- [Passwordless](./guides/passwordless.mdx): Use passwordless authentication.
- [WebAuthn](./guides/webauthn.mdx): Add two-factor authentication through WebAuthn.
- [Per-Session MFA](./guides/per-session-mfa.mdx): Per-session multi-mactor authentication.
- [Locking](./guides/locking.mdx): Lock access to active user sessions or hosts.
- [Moderated Sessions](./guides/moderated-sessions.mdx): Require session auditors and allow fine-grained live session access.
