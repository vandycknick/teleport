This guide will talk through how to setup Teleport with Jira. Teleport's Jira integration allows you to treat Teleport access and permission requests using Jira tickets.

## Setup

This guide assumes that you have:

- A running Teleport Cluster
- Admin privileges with access to `tctl`
- Jira Server or Jira Cloud installation with an owner privileges, specifically to setup webhooks, issue types, and workflows

Teleport Cloud requires that plugins connect through the Proxy Service (`mytenant.teleport.sh:443`). Open Source and Enterprise installations can connect to the Auth Service (`auth.example.com:3025`) directly.


### Create a user and role for access

(!docs/pages/includes/plugins/rbac-update.mdx!)

### Export the access-plugin certificate

(!docs/pages/includes/plugins/identity-export.mdx!)

We'll reference these files later when [configuring the plugins](#configuration-file).

## Setting up your Jira project

### Creating the permission management project

All new permission requests are going to show up in a project you choose. We recommend that you create a separate project for permissions management, and a new board in said project.

You'll need the project Jira key to configure the plugin.

### Setting up the status board

Create a new board for tasks in the permission management project. The board has to have at least these three columns:

1. Pending
2. Approved
3. Denied

Teleport's Jira plugin will create a new issue for each new permission request in the first available column on the board. When you drag the request task to the Approved column in Jira, the request will be approved. If you drag the request task to the Denied column in Jira, the request will be denied.

### Setting up a request ID field on Jira

The Teleport Jira plugin requires a custom issue field to be created.

Go to your Jira Project settings → Issue Types → Select type `Task` → add a new Short Text field named `TeleportAccessRequestId`.

Teleport uses this field to reference its internal request ID. If anyone changes this field on Jira, or tries to forge the permission request, Teleport will validate it and ignore it.

### Getting your Jira API token

If you're using Jira Cloud, navigate to [Account Settings → Security → API Tokens](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens) and create a new app specific API token in your Jira installation. You'll need this token later to configure the plugin.

For Jira Server, the URL of the API tokens page will be different depending on your installation.

### Setting up Jira webhooks

Go to Settings → General → System → Webhooks and create a new webhook for Jira to tell the Teleport plugin about updates.

For the webhook URL, use the URL that you'll run the plugin on. It needs to be a publicly accessible URL (we will show you how to set this up later). Jira requires the webhook listener to run over HTTPS.

The webhook needs to be notified only about new issues being created, issues being updated, or deleted. You can leave all the other boxes empty.

<Admonition
  type="note"
  title="Plugin Defaults"
>
  Jira will send updates about any issues in any projects in your Jira installation to the webhook. We suggest that you use JQL filters to limit which issues are being sent to the plugin.

  The plugin's web server will run with TLS, but you can disable it with `--insecure-no-tls` to test things out in a dev environment.
</Admonition>

In the webhook settings page, make sure that the webhook will only send Issue Updated updates. It's not critical if anything else gets sent, since the plugin will just ignore everything else.

## Installing

We recommend installing Teleport plugins alongside the Teleport Proxy. This is an ideal
location as plugins have a low memory footprint, and will require both public internet access
and Teleport Auth Service access.

  To install from source you need `git` and `go` installed. If you do not have Go installed, visit the Go [downloads page](https://go.dev/dl/).

  ```code
  # Checkout teleport-plugins
  $ git clone https://github.com/gravitational/teleport-plugins.git
  $ cd teleport-plugins/access/jira
  $ make
  ```
Run `./install` from `teleport-jira` or place the executable in `/usr/bin` or `/usr/local/bin` on the server installation.

## Configuration file

Depending on whether you are running the plugin as an executable in a
non-containerized environment or on Kubernetes, follow the appropriate
instructions for your environment to configure the plugin:

<TabItem

The Teleport Jira plugin uses a config file in TOML format. Generate a
boilerplate config by running the following command:

```code
$ teleport-jira configure > teleport-jira.toml
$ sudo mv teleport-jira.toml /etc
```

By default, the Jira Teleport plugin will use a config in
`/etc/teleport-jira.toml`, and you can override it with `-c
config/file/path.toml` flag.

The configuration file will resemble the following:

```toml
(!examples/resources/plugins/teleport-jira-cloud.toml!)
```

The Teleport Jira plugin uses a config file in TOML format. Generate a
boilerplate config by running the following command:

```code
$ teleport-jira configure > teleport-jira.toml
$ sudo mv teleport-jira.toml /etc
```

By default, the Jira Teleport plugin will use a config in
`/etc/teleport-jira.toml`, and you can override it with `-c
config/file/path.toml` flag.

The configuration file will resemble the following:

```toml
(!examples/resources/plugins/teleport-jira-self-hosted.toml!)
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem

Create a file called `values.yaml` with the following content, which configures
the Helm chart for the plugin. It should resemble the following:

```yaml
(!examples/resources/plugins/teleport-jira-helm-cloud.yaml!)
```

Use the following command to create the Kubernetes secret referenced in the
values file from the identity file you generated earlier:

```console
kubectl create secret generic teleport-plugin-jira-identity --from-file=auth_id=auth.pem
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem 
options="Helm Chart" 
label="Connect to the Auth Service "

Create a file called `values.yaml` with the following content, which configures
the Helm chart for the plugin. It should resemble the following:

```yaml
(!examples/resources/plugins/teleport-jira-helm-self.yaml!)
```

Use the following command to create the Kubernetes secret referenced in the
values file from the identity file you generated earlier:

```console
kubectl create secret generic teleport-plugin-jira-identity --from-file=auth_id=auth.pem
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The `[teleport]` section describes where the teleport service running, and what keys should the plugin use to authenticate itself. Use the keys that you've generated.

The `[jira]` section requires a few things:

1. Your Jira Cloud or Jira Server URL. For Jira Cloud, it looks something like `yourcompany.atlassian.net`.
2. Your username on Jira, i.e. [ben@goteleport.com](mailto:ben@goteleport.com)
3. Your Jira API token that you've created above.
4. A Jira Project key, available in Project settings.

The `[http]` setting block describes how the plugin's HTTP server works. The HTTP server is responsible for listening for updates from Jira, and processing updates, like when someone drags a task from Inbox to Approved column.

You must provide an address the server should listen on, and a certificate to use. It's possible to
run the Jira plugin on the same server as the Teleport Proxy, so you can use the same TLS certificate.

## Testing

You should be able to run the Teleport plugin now!


<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Executable" scopes={["oss", "enterprise", "cloud"]}>
```code
$ teleport-jira start
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Helm Chart" scopes={["oss", "enterprise", "cloud"]}>
```code
$ helm install teleport-plugin-jira teleport/teleport-plugin-jira --values teleport-jira-helm.yaml
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The log output should look familiar to what Teleport service logs. You should see that it connected to Teleport, and is listening for new Teleport requests and Jira webhooks.

Go ahead and test it:

```code
$ tsh login --request-roles=admin
```

That should create a new permission request on Teleport (you can test if it did with `tctl request ls`), and you should see a new task on your Jira project board.

### Set up systemd

In production, we recommend starting the Teleport plugin daemon via an init system like systemd.
Here's the recommended Teleport plugin service unit file for systemd:

```txt
(!examples/systemd/plugins/teleport-jira.service!)
```

Save this as `teleport-jira.service`. Make sure the `teleport-jira start` command includes a `--config` flag that refers to the configuration file you created earlier.

## Audit log

The plugin will let anyone with access to the Jira board approve/deny requests so it's
important to review Teleport's audit log.

## Feedback
